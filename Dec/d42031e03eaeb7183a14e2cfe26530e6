The Independent Communications Authority of South Africa kept the imploding SABC in check by setting aside its protest ban policy and the courts did their best to keep Hlaudi Motsoeneng away from the public broadcaster.And parliament finally held the SABC to account, but the legislature's record in other respects was less impressive.There can be no constitutional objection to criminalising hate speech as defined in the constitution, and people like Penny Sparrow, who made the news in January with a racist post on social media, deserve to be vilified and punished.The breadth of the wording in the Prevention and Combating of Hate Crimes and Hate Speech Bill, however, may create difficulties for legitimate satire and stand-up comedy because the draft punishes insulting speech in addition to hate speech as constitutionally defined.Expect strong push-back from free-speech advocates when it is discussed in parliament.Hlaudi's dirty war at SABCThe ANC's promise to spearhead the repeal of criminal defamation in the interests of media freedom was also postponed to next year for no apparent reason.And disgracefully, our government voted against a UN resolution promoting and protecting human rights, including freedom of expression, on the internet.But let's focus on the good stuff.Two Supreme Court of Appeal cases significantly added to our jurisprudence on openness.In the Nova case, the court vindicated Moneyweb's right to access the share registers of companies linked to the Sharemax group. The court held that the Companies Act creates an unqualified entitlement to share registers within 14 days of a request.The company that is the recipient of the request may not refuse to provide the information on any basis - as the court stated, the establishment of a company is "not purely a private matter" and an unqualified right of access is "essential for effective journalism and an informed citizenry".This judgment cements the hard work done by organisations like the amaBhungane investigative journalism unit to ensure that an unqualified right was adopted by parliament. It materially enhances investigative journalism.In the Primedia case, the court ruled that the jamming of cellphone signals at President Jacob Zuma's state of the nation address from parliament in February last year was unlawful, as were parliament's broadcasting policy and rules because they permitted the cameras to focus on the presiding officer when incidents of unparliamentary conduct or grave disorder occur.The factual context of the case was that members of the EFF were violently evicted from parliament after they interrupted the president to ask when he would pay back the public money spent on upgrading his private residence at Nkandla. Yet members of the public watching on TV were deprived of any visuals of this eviction.The court accepted that broadcasting can provide greater accuracy of immediate events than other forms of reporting, and "the public is entitled to see and hear scenes of disruption so that it can call MPs to account".The Primedia decision builds on the broadcast access jurisprudence that culminated in the Oscar Pistorius judgment, where broadcasters were granted the right to broadcast the audio and some of the video of the evidence in Pistorius's murder trial.Two years after the Pistorius judgment, our courts have become very familiar with the broadcasting of aspects of their proceedings: it is a sign of how far we have come that televised visuals of court proceedings of public interest are now commonplace. While time will tell whether the SABC will recover from the self-inflicted body blows, this week has been a victory for accountability and transparency One broadcaster, however, that did not wish to broadcast all matters of public interest was the public broadcaster.It has been yet another abysmal year for the SABC, which has been rocked by one scandal after another. At the heart of each was one man: Motsoeneng.In June, Icasa accepted the recommendation of its complaints and compliance committee and ruled invalid the controversial protest ban policy which Motsoeneng, then chief operating officer, had imposed on SABC journalists.The policy stated that the SABC would not show footage of people burning public institutions during service delivery protests.There was no rational justification for this blatant self-censorship and the committee easily concluded that the policy violated the Broadcasting Act, the constitution and the SABC's licence conditions."South Africa is not, as in the apartheid era, a dictatorship," said the committee's chairman Kobus van Rooyen.And then, just last week, the High Court in Cape Town set aside Motsoeneng's appointment as SABC corporate affairs executive - a position to which he was appointed after a Supreme Court of Appeal ruling finally set aside his appointment as chief operating officer.In the words of the court, the appointment had been made "despite the fact that serious adverse findings in the public protector's report had not been set aside and despite subsequent events which cast a further significant shadow over his integrity and leadership abilities".The court held that, unless the public protector's findings against Motsoeneng are set aside or he is exonerated in a valid, public disciplinary hearing, he may not hold any position at all at the SABC.An era that cries out loud for ethical leadershipIn what was a bad week for Motsoeneng, his conduct was also subjected to intense scrutiny in parliament's inquiry into the SABC, with a variety of witnesses testifying to the decline of the SABC under his watch.While time will tell whether the SABC will recover from the self-inflicted body blows, this week has been a victory for accountability and transparency.Other victories for accountability this year included the High Court in Pietermaritzburg ruling that the disciplinary inquiries of a number of employees of the Department of Public Works be open to the media and the public.All of these inquiries concern the role of state employees in the processes leading to the upgrades at Nkandla.Judge Piet Koen ruled that media houses "are duty bound, with vigour, courage, integrity and responsibility, to report on the Nkandla upgrades (including the disciplinary proceedings in question) and, absent any cogent evidence of irreparable harm, should not be prevented from doing so".The theme of greater openness was also evident in the ruling by a senior commissioner of the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration that the arbitration between Adrian Lackay, former spokesman of the South African Revenue Service, and his former employer be open to the public.This case, to be heard next year, is clearly of massive public interest and the decision should be welcomed.It might shed further light on the "SARS wars" which have eroded the public's faith in an institution that was once a jewel in the government's crown.Many challenges lie ahead for South Africa and its media in 2017. But if the judiciary's performance this year is a yardstick, the constitutional rights to media freedom, freedom of expression and access to information are all secure foundations of our democracy.Milo is a partner at Webber Wentzel Attorneys and visiting associate professor in media law at the University of the Witwatersrand
