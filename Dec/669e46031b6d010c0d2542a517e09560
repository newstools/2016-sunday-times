Guardiola said he wants to see rules changed to allow for up to six substitutes to be used in a game rather than the three at present as a means to prevent burn-out of top stars."It's just three substitutions now, why can you not make four, five or six?," said the Spaniard. "All the players are involved more than before, the coaches can use different tactics."Less injuries, more open games. Everything would be better."The City boss was speaking after Fifa president Gianni Infantino expressed his desire to increase the number of teams playing at the World Cup from 2026. 'Banned' sports codes find straight and narrow 'Banned' sports codes now on the straight and narrowBut he fears that such demands will push players to breaking point. "It's not just English football, it's all around the world."Now they talk about a World Cup of 48 teams - we are going to kill the players," he said."Fifa will decide and we accept the decision and if we are not happy we go home."They are focusing on more and more and more - it affects the quality. I am thinking just for the players. They need to breathe, to (have a) break, to enjoy."This kind of thing is impossible because we are going to finish (the season), then after one week the World Cup, then after three weeks we go to the pre-season, we go to China, the States, Australia."A decision on whether to expand the World Cup will be made next month and any change would be unlikely to take effect before 2026, but Guardiola is unconvinced by the idea."I am thinking just for the players. They need to breathe, to [have a] break, to enjoy."Guardiola says increasing the number of substitutes available would lead to fewer injuries and more open games.
