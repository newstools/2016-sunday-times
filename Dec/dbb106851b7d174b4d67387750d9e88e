The 55th anniversary commemorations of Umkhonto weSizwe were marred by deep divisions in the ranks of the former combatants.It is unfortunate that the factionalism that is tearing the ANC apart has spilt over into MK ranks.What was meant to be a moment of deep reflection on and remembrance of the selflessness of former combatants was overshadowed by heckling and tussles between those who want to perpetuate the status quo of corruption, nepotism, self-centredness, denialism and arrogance, and those who aim to "disinfect" - to borrow Joel Netshitenze's terminology - the ANC of all that is causing the cancer eating away at its soul.Marching in the footsteps of MK hero Solomon MahlanguFirst, there was the marginalisation and neglect of genuine former MK combatants while young men were paraded as military veterans.Then came the announcement that Hlaudi Motsoeneng, Brian Molefe and Dudu Myeni - disgraced individuals implicated in corruption and state capture - will be honoured as part of the activities to commemorate the establishment of MK.Former combatants had had enough and rejected the ill-conceived awards. These members convened an unprecedented national council to conduct a diagnosis of the MK Military Veterans Association, the ANC Veterans' League and, most importantly, the ANC itself.How refreshing and invigorating it was to listen to and participate in frank, open and robust discussions about the ills festering within the ranks of these organisations and what needed to be done to urgently and decisively cure the ANC's self-inflicted wounds, given its leadership role to its constituent parts, its alliance partners and in broader South African society.With less singing and rhetoric than have characterised recent ANC meetings, the scene was set by the opening address and the political overview to critically look at how as the ANC family we have contributed, by omission or commission, to the morass.The political overview went even further to present a prognosis that pointed to a bleak future for the ANC and the country unless urgent and decisive steps are taken to change the self-destructive trajectory the current ANC leadership is pursuing.Joined by the legendary 101 stalwarts and veterans, the more than 2000 delegates knuckled down to the business of examining the causes of the crisis and how the envisaged national consultative conference may assist in restoring the ANC to its former glory.The focus also fell on the dysfunctionality of the ANC Veterans' League and the rogue behaviour and posture of the MKMVA. There were no holy cows.Former commanders, commissars and combatants were clear in their minds that they would not let their organisations be destroyed by those with nefarious intentions. They also made it clear that they would not let their country go to waste.It was resolved that all former combatants had to play an active role in the renewal programme of the ANC.The former combatants are offended by the institutionalisation of factions, entrenched denialism and concomitant arrogance, gate-keeping and vote-buying and the insatiable lust for power and crass materialism ravaging the ANC. One step forward, two back with Teflon ZumaCorruption, self-centredness and the general loss of the moral compass by some in ANC ranks stand out as having contributed immensely to the people losing trust and confidence in the ANC.As we usher in 2017, the 105th anniversary of the oldest liberation movement in Africa, we expect to see concerted political efforts to ensure that the proposed national consultative conference will be as broad as possible to include society beyond the ANC.Delinking the national policy and consultative conferences must be debated to allow more time for reflection, internalisation and formulation of conference decisions into coherent policy by ANC members.Concerted efforts will see both the MKMVA and ANC Veterans' League conferences being held and attended by genuine members and focusing on issues relevant to their members.In convening these conferences, including the national consultative conference, former combatants want to be part of their preparatory or steering committees so as to inform the form, content and shape of these gatherings that they do not degenerate into divisive, irrelevant talk shops.Former combatants are impatient with the rot that has set in across ANC ranks and are committed to formulate and implement a turn-around programme - including how the ANC vets and elects its leaders.Given the vibrant, frank and robust spirit that prevailed throughout the MK veterans national council, there is a glimmer of hope that the ANC will be pulled from the abyss and our country returned to a healthy development trajectory.
