"Our economy is on very shaky ground with a ratings downgrade to junk status a very real possibility. In a year in which President Zuma could not recite his own Nine-Point Plan to reduce unemployment in Parliament over 9-million South Africans remained jobless with the unemployment rate hitting a 13-year high."Our universities are in perpetual crisis as looting and destruction continues. Campus shutdowns resulted in many losing an entire year of studies having harsh knock-on effects for the economy. Student demands for free education have been met with no ideas or real action by government leading to more frustration."And to top it all off his government announced its intention to withdraw from the International Criminal Court (ICC) a move that betrays our historical commitment to a human rights based foreign policy and tells the rest of the world that we do not believe in holding those who commit the most horrendous of acts such as genocide and war crimes to account."Referring to the concerns over his close ties with the Gupta family also flagged by the Public Protector's office Maimane noted: "The year 2016 will go down as one of the most unfortunate and regrettable for our beloved country which is rapidly being steered well off track by President Jacob Zuma. This year reads like an almost hard to believe Hollywood script of how one man has single-handedly captured a country in order to make himself and those connected to him rich wreaking havoc at every juncture along the way."Maimane saying President Zuma has inflicted incalculable damage to SA's economy and our international reputation added: "In any other democracy his presidency would not have survived 2016".His comments were contained in a "report card" produced by the official opposition to score the performance of Zuma deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa and 37 government ministers.Pass marks were awarded by the DA to Science and Technology Minister Naledi Pandor and Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan who were scored B. A C pass was awarded to ministers such as Ngoako Ramatlhodi (Department of Public Service &amp; Administration) Derek Hanekom (Tourism) Ebrahim Patel (Economic Development) and Nathi Mthethwa (Arts and Culture).A majority (23) of members in the executive scored an E symbol or worse.The worst symbol possible (F-) was reserved for Zuma and the ministers of mineral resources as well as cooperative governance and traditional affairs.Maimane said Zuma started the year off on a rocky note when he removed former finance minister Nhlanhla Nene and replaced him with Des van Rooyen for less than a weekend before replacing him with Gordhan. Maimane said what would follow that faux pas was a year in which loyal Zuma ministers would tie themselves closer to him and a year in which the Constitutional Court told Zuma that he violated his oath of office.Ramaphosa received a D symbol given a lack of progress in programmes under his responsibility such as the turnaround of state-owned enterprises and mediation between party leaders in his role as leader of government business.DA chief whip John Steenhuisen said Zwane emerged as one of the poorest performers due to his ties to the influential Gupta family detailed in the last report of former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela while Van Rooyen s ardent defence of Zuma and the Guptas and his attempt at interdicting the State Capture report meant that he was ineffectual as a minister.Ministers who received the F symbol included Water and Sanitation Minister Nomvula Mokonyane Police Minister Nathi Nhleko Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown and State Security Minister David Mahlobo.A further 18 ministers including Minister of Higher Education and Training Blade Nzimande and Defence Minister Nosiviwe Masipa Nqakula scored a D symbol.Of the ministers who scored a pass mark Gordhan was doing his best even though he "effectively has both hands tied behind his back and is simply not able to ensure that structural reform to boost economic growth and create jobs is implemented in South Africa" the DA said.The DA however noted that "behind the calm measured and reassuring tone are some numbers which should be of concern".These include:- economic growth has been revised down once again to 0.5%;- inflation is spiralling outside the target range at 6.4%;- the fiscal deficit has been revised up to R150.5 billion or 3.4% of GDP despite drawing down the entire R6 billion contingency reserve;- net loan debt which is at a staggering R2 trillion or 45.8% of GDP will now only stabilize at R2.63 trillion or 47.9% in 2018/19; and- debt service costs which are the fastest growth item of expenditure in the budget are R147.7 billion."The Minister is absolutely correct that the solution is to boost economic growth and to create jobs in South Africa."(But a) Minister who has no control over economic policy development or its implementation can do very little...".Pandor was praised for her commitment to her portfolio and good financial management."We believe she truly wants the Science Technology and Innovation sector to thrive and to be a more dominant role player in the economy. She tries to achieve this with a very limited budget " the DA said."One of the main challenges in the Science and Technology field is funding and it is unfortunate that this Department is seriously underfunded. The percentage of GDP spent on Research and Development (R&amp;D) in South Africa should be in the region of 1.5% but currently trails behind fellow BRICS countries at 0.76%. The Minister has taken action to improve this situation by establishing a joint government-industry task team to evaluate and propose recommendations to improve the design and administration of the R&amp;D Tax Incentive."On her financial accountability the party said: "The Minister and her Department can be commended for the excellent audit reports obtained. The Department received a clean audit report and the entities reporting to it also mostly received clean or unqualified reports. For the 2015/16 financial year the Department spent 99.6% of its budget and achieved 84% of its performance targets. It remains one of the best-managed government departments.""The staff complement especially at the management level remains stable and the Director-General has been in the position for a number of years. This creates continuity and a stable working environment. Department presentations are always well-prepared and comprehensive."- TMG Digital additional reporting by BusinessLive
