Ryan Stramrood's idea of a white Christmas swimming in icy water.A maximum temperature of 5 C is one of the prerequisites for this extreme sport as determined by the International Ice Swimming Association (IISA).Other stipulations are wearing a Speedo-type costume, goggles and a cap. No wetsuits or greasing of body parts allowed.Stramrood and five South African teammates will compete at the biennial ice-swimming world championships in Germany next month where they must complete 1km. Taking up fight: Stramrood grows fins Stramrood, who by his own admission isn't a racer, is an adventure swimmer who holds the record for being the only person to swim in sub-zero temperature.The father of one did a mile in Antarctica in water temperature at minus one; the freezing point of sea water is much lower than fresh water because of the salt content.It took him 32 minutes, and by the time he emerged he was hypothermic, which meant he was unable to shiver, the body's attempt to generate heat."I didn't shiver for approximately the first 15 minutes being out the water. Shivering is good - that means you're on the mend, your body's warming up."Stramrood, 43, said there was a heated room for his recovery, with medics who dried him and kept him conscious, talking to him.Medical attention is critical because for a while afterwards the swimmer's core temperature continues to drop, a phenomenon known as the after drop, where cold blood from the extremities returns to the core.He was "broken" after his Antarctic feat."I was dazed and confused in the recovery room. It's almost like an out-of-body experience, it feels similar - you know you're there, you know everyone's running around you like crazy, but you're not entirely compos mentis [having full control of one's mind]."From there, he was escorted to a shower where he sat on the floor while the water temperature was slowly increased.And that's when the pain starts. "A lot of the nerve-endings have been damaged, usually underneath your fingernails and toenails. It's painful for about 15 to 20 minutes at that level. I have been in such pain I haven't known what the hell to do with myself..."That is absolutely excruciating," said the Capetonian, who has a sponsor, the Liberty Group, for his daring - or is that crazy? - feats."It's literally like you have put your finger down on a table and someone has taken a hammer and smashed each and every one individually."It's painful for about 15 to 20 minutes at that level. I have been in such pain I haven't known what the hell to do with myself. But then other swims the pain has been a lot less."Stramrood, a founding member of IISA with many fellow adventurers, like Ram Barkai, Andrew Chin, Toks Viviers and Kieron Palframan, says the 1km world championships is not as dangerous.The event in Germany will be in a lake where ice will be cut out in the shape of a 25m pool, with lane ropes to boot.Preparing for an ice swim requires mental focus to get the mind ready for the shock of the water."I need to squash the panic, the pain, the hyperventilation that's going to happen," he said."I mustn't sprint the first five lengths because I'm so pumped with adrenaline and pain," added Stramrood, who also does press-ups and squats to warm up and get as much blood in his muscles. An extreme adventurer who makes a differenceThe moment he hits the water, the blood will rush from his extremities to his core to protect his vital organs."I will also make myself angry, throw punches ... the more angry you are the more heat you generate internally, but basically it's just a mental focus."For training at home, he swims in the Peninsula's colder waters on the Atlantic seaboard, and occasionally he sits in an ice bath at the I&amp;J fisheries."We bring the water down to 0 C, we get in our Speedos and we sit in that for 10 minutes to condition the body, and the mind, more importantly," said Stramrood, who owns an advertising sales house and does motivational speaking.He started swimming merely to exercise in 2,000, and then he embarked on Robben Island swims, going around Cape Point and eventually the English Channel.Stramrood departs for Germany on Tuesday.sports@timesmedia.co.za
