They could well have served as inspiration for South African athletes who thrilled, wowed and dazzled at the Rio Olympics.Wayde van Niekerk ran the race of his life in the unwanted lane eight to smash a 17-year 400m world record.Caster Semenya reclaimed her place as 800m champion. Luvo Manyonga lifted himself from the decadence of drugs to leap to a silver medal, missing out on the gold by a hair's breadth.Ntando Mahlangu became the poster boy of our Paralympic team. By sprinting to a silver medal in the 200m a mere six months after learning to walk on his prosthetic legs, the 14-year-old - and his teammates who brought home 17 medals - proved that being disabled does not mean being unable.And who can forget the Proteas' whitewash of the Australians? These highlights, including the incredibly impressive manner in which Mamelodi Sundowns captured the Confederation of African Football Champions League crown, gave unbridled joy to millions of sport-addicted South Africans.In 2017, we want more of the same from Bafana Bafana, who are on course to qualify for the 2018 Soccer World Cup in Russia. Those who worship Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates will hope the not-so-giant Soweto outfits remember that today's results count more than yesterday's reputations.And we trust that 2017 will remind the boys who play around with the oval-shaped ball to reintroduce the word "winning" to their vocabulary. South African rugby must get its house in order if the Springboks are not to be renamed the Biltongs.
