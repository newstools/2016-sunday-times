THE BRACE POSITIONI need to travel to Cape Town before Christmas but, after an accident, I have a leg in a brace and so cannot bend my knee entirely. This makes flying very difficult and the airlines I have approached are not that helpful.I need assistance in getting onto the plane, but also a seat where I can keep my leg fairly straight. Any suggestions on how I can do this, bar booking three seats? - Delores Shaw Ask Andrew: How to leave SA with a residence permit (& get back in)Airlines do offer wheelchair assistance for those boarding planes, buy only on certain flights on certain days so you must state this requirement upfront when booking.The very best seats on a plane for people who are temporarily inconvenienced by a plaster cast or leg brace are those on the emergency exit, but unfortunately usually only able-bodied people are allowed to sit there, as they are always briefed on helping in the event of an emergency.On international flights those seats cost more, so the occupants will usually refuse to move if asked to.Airlines will never turn away a customer and can always make a plan.The best options are to fly business class on SAA or British Airways Comair or book an aisle seat, preferably at the back of the plane.A far better option would be to take a train to Cape Town. It can be a wonderful experience and you will be more comfortable.Two services are offered - the standard Shosholoza Meyl passenger trains which run a few times a week between Joburg and Cape Town, and the more luxurious Premier Classe train. See Shosholoza Meyl for both.</img>If you need it, ask for a wheelchair when you book the flight. Image: iSTOCK If you need it, ask for a wheelchair when you book the flight.
