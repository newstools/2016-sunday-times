This Mampara spoilt what should have been a celebration of his 100 days in office by ranting about immigrants, mostly African, who he accused of being "criminals ... holding our country to ransom".His callous remarks echo the inflammatory and xenophobic statements of King Goodwill Zwelithini last year.They put him in the same league as that other Mampara, DA Sea Point councillor Shayne Ramsay, who called homeless people "criminals" and "mentally retarded".
