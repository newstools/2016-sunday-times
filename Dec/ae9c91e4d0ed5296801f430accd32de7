AB InBev, which bought SABMiller for more than $100-million in October, has been rumoured to be eyeing beverage maker PepsiCo, which may be why Coca-Cola, a former ally of SAB, is cutting its losses.Anthony Geard, a food and beverages analyst at Investec Securities, said AB InBev, specifically in South America, was a bottler for Pepsi, which might be why the Coca-Cola Company felt "uncomfortable" having a commercial relationship with AB InBev."SABMiller had a long and deep relationship with the Coca-Cola Company and AB InBev does not have that relationship," said Geard.On Wednesday, the Coca-Cola Company announced that it had entered into a deal to buy AB InBev's 54.5% stake in Coca-Cola Beverages Africa, which includes businesses in South Africa, Namibia, Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Ghana, Mayotte and Comoros.The Coca-Cola Company said it also planned to acquire AB InBev's interest in bottling operations in Zambia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Swaziland, Lesotho, El Salvador and Honduras for an undisclosed amount.Geard said the sale of Coca-Cola Beverages Africa completed a long list of divestments for AB InBev.Earlier this month, AB InBev announced the sale of its interest in Distell to the Public Investment Corporation as one of the conditions for its acquisition of SABMiller."They bought the whole of SABMiller and they paid a lot of money for it, and now they've been selling off assets, and the multiple at which they are selling those assets is lower than what they paid, but with every divestment there has been some value," said Geard.Coca-Cola's revenue in Africa equated to about 9% of SABMiller's total profits, he said.Kathleen van Boxelaer, director of external communications at AB InBev, said the company would not be disclosing the full-year ebitda of Coca-Cola Beverages Africa. But she said "both parties have expressed satisfaction with the terms of the transactions"."We intend to work constructively with the Coca-Cola Company to ensure an orderly and efficient process and to minimise any disruption to our business," said Boxelaer.In a company statement, the Coca-Cola Company said it planned to hold all of the concerned territories temporarily until they could be refranchised to other partners.Geard said the company might lean on one of its European or Asian partners."I certainty don't think that there would be an African partner for Coca-Cola."However, he added, "It's possible that Coca-Cola Beverages Africa could list on the Johannesburg bourse."Coca-Cola Company may choose to place that stock in the market, so that would be quite an exciting alternative," said Geard.But it remained unclear who Coca-Cola would sell its stake to."I don't think Coke would be happy being the anchor shareholder forever, so there will be something interesting happening down the line," Geard added.The transactions are subject to regulatory and minority approvals, which are expected to close by the end of 2017.
