The 51-year-old, who works at the Department of Trade and Industry, portrayed himself as a "benevolent philanthropist", Acting Judge Avrille Maier-Frawley said in the High Court in Pretoria.But in her judgment last week she said his evidence about money lacked credibility and he had ignored a string of court orders.Maier-Frawley said the man and his 55-year-old wife - neither of whom may be named - had shown "an alarming inability to manage large sums of money".The marriage began with a Valentine's Day wedding in 1996. The husband alleged, however, that his wife continued sleeping with a boyfriend.She counter-claimed that she suspected him of infidelity after catching him caressing another woman's breasts at a party, and "in the years following, there was a decline in intimacy in the marriage and sexual relations became strained", said the judge."In 2015, [the wife] found condoms, penis-enlargement pills and gels in [her husband's] gym bag. She also discovered hotel receipts and cellphone money transfers ... to a certain gentleman. She confronted [her husband] about having an extramarital affair but he refused to provide answers. This led to physical altercations ... which resulted in [the husband] being hospitalised."The husband denied having an affair with the man, telling the court he was merely the man's mentor.The husband, meanwhile, had spent almost R2-million more than he earned within two years."For the whole of 2013, [the couple] had no water or electricity in their house as municipal bills were not paid," said the judge."That same year, [the husband] purchased a Mercedes SLK ... asserting that it was 'his money'."
