As everyone knows, the DA engages in a great deal of litigation. Some of this litigation is directed against the executive and parliament.We do so very reluctantly, for a number of reasons.First, it's very expensive. Second, it blurs the separation of powers, and most judges do not like being put in a situation where they have to tell parliament or the executive what to do.But we bring these cases because the National Assembly doesn't do what the constitution requires it to do.Section 42(3) of the constitution gives the National Assembly the duty to scrutinise and oversee executive action.Likewise, section 55(2) tells us that the National Assembly must provide for mechanisms to ensure the accountability of the executive and organs of state. Look beyond a broken ANC for solutions to our impasse The National Assembly has dismally failed to do this.Let me remind you of some of its most serious failures.First, there was the appointment of Advocate Menzi Simelane as national director of public prosecutions.Everybody who understood the law knew that he was not a "fit and proper person" to occupy that post.One would have expected the parliamentary portfolio committee on justice to have interrogated his appointment; to have called the then justice minister Jeff Radebe or even President Jacob Zuma before parliament to explain why such a controversial figure had been appointed to such an important post.Instead, radio silence.It was left to the DA to challenge Simelane's appointment. The case went all the way to the Constitutional Court, where Justice Zak Yacoob did what parliament should have done - and fired him.Then there was the Nkandla debacle.The National Assembly appointed no fewer than three ad hoc committees to consider public protector Thuli Madonsela's report.In two of the three cases, the opposition submitted minority reports that articulated our view that the public protector's remedial action was binding unless reviewed by a court of law, and that, absent of this, the president was legally compelled to pay for the non-security upgrades.The lengths to which the National Assembly went to evade its responsibility to hold the president to account were pathetic, and would have been comical had they not been so serious.We saw ANC MP Mathole Motshekga telling us that the public protector only had advisory powers.We saw Minister of Police Nathi Nhleko telling us - to the strains of warbling music - that the president owed nothing, and that he had actually been short-changed. Something wonderful emerges from this terrible time We saw "content advisers" and "legal advisers" giving spectacularly wrong advice.It was left to the DA and the EFF to go to the Constitutional Court to establish that the president was obliged to pay, and that he had broken his oath of office.Then there is the ongoing action in which the DA has been engaged since 2014 to get rid of Hlaudi Motsoeneng as chief operating officer of the SABC.Only after three court cases does it appear that the parliamentary portfolio committee on communications will do the right thing and fire the SABC board.The question remains: why did it take it so long?But the most serious failure by the ANC majority in the National Assembly has been its persistent failure to hold Zuma to account for his acts and omissions that have fallen far short of what is expected of the president of South Africa.The ANC had ample opportunity, created by the opposition, to act against Zuma this year.The ANC let parliament down.The ANC betrayed the concept of executive accountability.The ANC let South Africa down.
