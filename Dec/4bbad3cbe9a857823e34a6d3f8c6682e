The Spaniard has come under increasing pressure in recent weeks and been ridiculed for some of his claims in press conferences.City remain fourth in the Premier League and while still in the Champions League, their form has dipped badly in recent weeks. They won their first 10 matches of the season, but have seen victory in only four out of 15 matches since the end of September.He has admitted he needs to improve."The reality is that you have to win," he said ahead of today's match against Arsenal. "When I came here I knew I had to win, immediately. It is unfair in many cases, but you know the big companies in the world - if something doesn't work, you have to find a solution." Young Reds keeper has to man up, work harderHaving favoured idealism over pragmatism throughout his career, Guardiola has accepted he must "swot up on English football", says Paul Wilson of The Guardian.He adds: "He may have glowing credentials as the best coach in the world, but he has never worked in this country [the UK] and it is beginning to show."How much pressure he is actually under is unclear. "City's owners spent four years trying to entice Guardiola to the Etihad Stadium and the firm expectation is that the former Barcelona and Bayern Munich head coach will be given time to implement the changes he wants to make in the hope of turning the club into a serious force domestically and in Europe," says James Ducker of the Daily Telegraph.After the Leicester City defeat, Guardiola both defended centreback John Stones, who was awarded two out of 10 for his performance by the Manchester Evening News, and showed a "flippant disregard" to questions about City's tackling, telling reporters: "I'm not a coach for tackles."His words are bound to infuriate those City fans who have begun to doubt the messianic status Guardiola was awarded at the start of the season.Meanwhile, it's none the better at Arsenal where familiar questions about courage, backbone and durability surround the Gunners ahead of their trip to City.Arsenal's 14-match unbeaten run had lain strong foundations for a determined tilt at the festive fixture list, only for Arsene Wenger's men to come unstuck in Tuesday's 2-1 defeat at Everton.Wenger was left to voice time-worn complaints about an opponent's "physical" approach, after his side shrivelled amid the Goodison Park roar, but Petr Cech is desperate to show Arsenal are no pushovers."You have to pick yourself up," the Arsenal goalkeeper said. "There is a big period coming up now with the games coming thick and fast and there is no time to dwell on the defeat."- The Week and AFP
