The finalised long-term rights for hake inshore trawl, confirmed this month, have left Viking Fishing high and dry with a nearly 1,000 ton slash in its quota. In papers before the High Court in Cape Town, Viking said the reduction would force the company to lay up more than half of its hake inshore fleet and retrench more than 100 workers at its Mossel Bay facility.Other industry stakeholders joined the chorus of protest this week, criticising the allocations, which have transferred a significant chunk of the quota to "new entrants" - companies with no fishing industry experience. The reductions have affected white- and black-owned companies, many of which are set to appeal the final allocations.Among the appellants is a 100% black-owned company operating two large trawlers, which had its quota cut, while some of the new companies have a smaller black shareholding. Langebaan fisherfolk find themselves in white waterHake inshore is a key fishery, particularly for the Southern Cape.Companies fear that the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries will apply the same reportedly faulty scoring methodology to other upcoming long-term rights allocations, including the most commercially significant, hake offshore, due to be announced in 2020.The department this week confirmed it would contest Viking's court application.Deputy director-general Siphokazi Ndudane said: "The department is currently affording all applicants an opportunity to follow internal processes and if and when any take us to court, we will definitely contest."In an affidavit before court, Viking Fishing financial director Rory Williams said Viking had made a R50-million investment: "A 60% cut of the applicant's historic right allocation would in due course force the applicant to close down the hake inshore trawl operations of its Mossel Bay factory once it has fished its allocation."It will have to lay up three or four of its five vessels and retrench between 110 and 125 of its full-time factory and other workers.Many of the concerns submitted to court were contained in Viking's submission to the department on December 8 following the publication of provisional lists.These included concerns about the number of new entrants - 12 in total - resulting in a 62% increase in hake inshore rights holders.In effect it would mean almost half of the rights holders would have no previous experience in the fishery and would likely become "paper quota holders" - not directly involved in fishing - thereby retarding economic growth and contradicting the department's own policy.Viking also questioned the department's reliance on a blunt black-ownership formula as its "quantum allocation mechanism", despite the fishing industry being significantly transformed relative to other industries according to the latest government statistics. The company also drew attention to apparent defects in some of the new entrants' applications."In studying the applications it has become apparent that there are a large number of defects and errors in the application forms," the company said. Fish-for-the-poor project challenged in courtApparent errors included a company misrepresenting ownership of a vessel that it doesn't own, others misrepresenting employment, and another showing no employment at all.Fishing industry executives this week were reluctant to comment, fearing recriminations in future allocations.However, Lionell Brown, co-director of Mossel Bay-based BMC, which is 100% black-owned, questioned why his company had lost out despite scoring fourth highest in the application process."We think it's not right. We've been in the industry for 15 years, and yet the guys with no experience received more quota than us. That doesn't make sense to me."By contrast, an existing rights holder that came last in the scoring received a 138% increase.Two industry executives who spoke off the record said other companies were likely to pursue legal action."We, alongside most other material players, have grave concerns about how this process has been run and some of the measures that have been used. We will undoubtedly appeal it."'Based on the reaction we get from the minister we could consider legal action. At the moment we don't agree with the way it's been handled," said one.jordanb@sundaytimes.co.za
