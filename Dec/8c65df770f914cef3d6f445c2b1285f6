With December here, one's thoughts turn naturally to smells and bells and holiday vibes. My favourite archangel is Gabriel who gave the Virgin Mary a surprising message as well as revealing the 96th chapter of the Qur'an to Mohammed.South Africans are rediscovering Cinsaut, the world's 'lost' wineGabriel also has a message for South African wine lovers: that Bot River is the new Bordeaux. Miraculously, it is also affordable, unlike the northern hemispheric version. Confirmation that it's better to travel hopefully than to arrive, Botrivier is an under-appreciated oasis on the road to Hermanus.Just outside Botrivier you'll find Gabrielskloof, the family-owned-and-run wine estate which produces Gabrielskloof The Blend 2015. This cabernet-dominated four-way blend of traditional Bordeaux varietals has dense cassis notes that are positively heavenly. Made by Peter-Allan Finlayson, this red is positively apostolic in its appeal.Great with game, add a block of ice if served at room temperature or chill briefly before serving if enjoyed at home. The take-no-prisoners alcohol level can cope with moderate dilution and a brief chill adds crispness.The year 2015 was a vintage wise men and some wine hacks foretold so cellar with pleasure if you prefer your good news postponed. When enjoyed sometime in the next decade, you'll whirl like a dervish about a wine of such quality at under R100 a bottle.Rating: 4/5 starsPrice: R85 per bottleWhere to buy?
