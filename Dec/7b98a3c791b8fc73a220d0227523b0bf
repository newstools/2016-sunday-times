Serves: 10Difficulty: EasyIngredients:1 packet Tennis biscuits100g butter, melted500ml cream2 tsp vanilla extract1 tsp salt1 tin condensed milk (chilled in the fridge)1 tbsp ground cinnamonPeppermint Crisp tartMethod:1) Line a 22cm loose-bottomed cake tin with baking paper as follows: Turn the removable base of the cake tin upside down and line it with a circle of baking paper that's 2cm wider than the base. Assemble the cake tin, letting the baking paper stick out underneath (see video below); this will make it easier to transfer the ice-cream cake to a plate once frozen. Create a 'collar' of baking paper to line the sides of the cake tin; this should be a few centimetres higher than the tin so it sticks out at the top. Use a little butter to stick the baking paper to the tin.2) To make the biscuit base, crush the Tennis biscuits until a fine crumb is achieved. Mix the crushed biscuits with the melted butter.3) Spoon the base mixture into the bottom of the cake tin; level it with the back of a spoon and press it down firmly with your hands to ensure it's tightly packed in the tin.4) To make the filling, add the vanilla extract and salt to the cream and whip until stiff peaks form. Add the condensed milk and whip for another few minutes.5) Pour the cream mix over the biscuit base and freeze until frozen. 6) Transfer the cake from the tin to a serving platter. Sprinkle with cinnamon and serve immediately.WATCH: How to make milk-tart ice-cream cake, step-by-step
