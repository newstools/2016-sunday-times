He's fathered 10,000 children and has six wives.But fear not, as he's unlikely to be strutting the streets of Sandton or Camps Bay - because he is a 5m, 500kg Nile crocodile living at a reptile sanctuary on the KwaZulu-Natal South Coast with his harem.The oldest known Nile crocodile in captivity in the world turns 116 on December 16.To mark the event, the Crocworld Conservation Centre in Scottburgh is throwing a bash in the geriatric reptile's honour.His pen - which he shares with his wives - will be transformed into "party central", where guests will be given ringside seats to witness Henry being served his favourite cuts of meat. The celebration would start with a "special birthday feeding and talk", said Crocworld Conservation Centre manager Martin Rodrigues."There will also be a cake as well as cupcakes for the guests."Rodrigues said Henry arrived 31 years ago when the centre opened."He arrived in 1985 as an adult with records that stated he was 85 years old. He measures 5m in length and weighs approximately 500kg."Henry shares the enclosure with six females. He still does mate with the various females on an annual basis."The mating season takes place from June until September and on average a female would lay 40 eggs."And according to Rodrigues, Henry has fathered at least 10,000 crocs over the years.According to the magazine African Expedition Volume 6, the crocodile "was a man-eater and ate several children".</img>A life in captivity has lengthened Henry's life.

And the secret to his longevity?"Crocodiles in captivity can certainly live much longer than those in the wild due to various factors," Rodrigues said.A controlled environment, constant supply of food and medical attention have all played a role.Had Henry not submitted himself to a life of "luxury", he would not have seen his record-breaking birthday."In the wild crocodiles are known to live to around 70, but in captivity there is no maximum life expectancy," he added.
