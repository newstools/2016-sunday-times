Following a disastrous campaign this year in which the Springboks won only four tests, Coetzee's fate will be determined in a review by SA Rugby's high performance committee over the next two days.With such a paltry record most coaches would be shown the door but with SA Rugby appear to be unable to buy Coetzee out of the remainder of his contract that expires at the end of 2019, rumoured to be in the region of R13-million.That may be a stretch for an organisation that, according to its chief executive Jurie Roux, will show a small loss when their next annual report is released.Moreover, an influential source at SA Rugby told the Sunday Times yesterday that there may be political pressure to retain the coach."I suppose they are also under pressure on the political front. I heard when they were recently in parliament they were told not to fire the coach," the source said.He added that Coetzee has had no option but to go about his work as if he will retain his job."Allister has to do presentations and he can't now sit back and take the approach that he has to wait for the committee to make a decision."That this year's Bok results sit uncomfortably with SA Rugby is all too clear from reports that the organisation has sussed out New Zealander Dave Rennie for the job.Another source within SA Rugby said apart from Rennie, SA Rugby had approached Lions coach Johan Ackermann, who declined the offer."From what I can gather the sentiment is very much for him (Coetzee) to leave. There are however a few stumbling blocks."Firstly, some want Johan Ackermann to take over but he has turned them down already. They have also turned to Dave Rennie but apparently he wants to select his own team. He does not want to be bound by a policy that restricts his selections."Thirdly, and I think this is the deal breaker, I don't think they've got the means to pay the coach out of his contract. The sponsors can't help them."Rennie has concluded a two-year contract to join Glasgow Warriors at the conclusion of next year's Super Rugby competition.He won two Super Rugby titles with the Chiefs (2012 and 2013) and is keen to gain experience outside New Zealand which is seen as a prerequisite to coaching the All Blacks. No overseas job can carry more weight than coaching the Springboks, but it may be a bit too much for a grizzled campaigner like Rennie.The Sunday Times could not reach Ackermann for comment.There had also been suggestions that SA Rugby had set their sights on former general manager of rugby, Rassie Erasmus, who took up the position of director of rugby at Irish outfit Munster earlier this year."I seriously doubt it is something Rassie would consider," a source close to Erasmus said yesterday. "When he left he had weighed everything up carefully and what has changed for him to want to come back?"Meanwhile SA Rugby's general council accepted a raft of constitutional changes, partly to help streamline their decision-making process."It is a pretty big day for SA Rugby in terms of how we are going to move forward," said Roux.Key changes approved were: Permitting 74% shareholdings in commercial arms of rugby unions by private-equity partners Increasing the make-up of the independent and player representation on the executive council to five independents with six elected members Introducing new committees for franchise (Super Rugby) and non-franchise rugby to focus and streamline decision-making Moving responsibility for the appointment of the Springbok coach and CEO from the general council to the executive council Removing the selection committee while retaining a selection convenor to work with national team coaches Aligning with the country's geopolitical boundaries by moving to nine members of SA Rugby, while retaining 14 playing unions Reducing the presidential roles from three to two by removing the vice-presidency from 2018.sports@timesmedia.co.za
