International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) council officials received an update from the task force looking at progress on anti-doping in Russia and whether there is any indication that the country could return to the athletics fold a year after being banned.Yesterday, the governing body's president Sebastian Coe presented his much-trumpeted "Time for Change" document to the IAAF congress, already approved by the council, which introduces a raft of measures to alter the way his organisation is run and policed.In his foreword to the document, Coe wrote: "It is a framework that will help the next generation to protect, promote and provide for athletes and athletics in a responsible, responsive, accessible and transparent way. It is time to leap, not to tip-toe."While Coe's focus is determinedly on the future, the stories still swirling around the IAAF's past refuse to go away.French newspaper Le Monde and German broadcaster ARD said last week they have seen evidence of demands for payments of hundreds of thousands of dollars by Russian athletes to IAAF officials in exchange for covering up failed drug tests.The documents were said to be from the ongoing probe by French prosecutors into former IAAF president Lamine Diack, his son Papa Massata Diack and others over alleged corruption and money-laundering.Reuters has not seen, nor is able to verify, the existence of those documents. France's national financial prosecutor's office declined to comment on Le Monde's report, in order to protect the investigation, it said.The IAAF said it was committed to rooting out any instances of wrongdoing in the past."We cannot comment on the specifics of the [Le Monde] article whilst the criminal investigation is under way," the governing body said in a statement."It is clear we all need to get to the bottom of what has happened, which is what the French criminal investigation is doing, and we continue to assist them as required."
