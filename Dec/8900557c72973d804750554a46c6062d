About 350 people have come forward since the floodgates were opened when Andy Woodward spoke out to The Guardian in London and there is growing incredulity that English football's governing body, the Football Association (FA), was unaware of the rumours and claims the abuse was going on.The scale of the abuse began to emerge last week after a string of ex-footballers, including England internationals, told of the crimes inflicted upon them, including years of being repeatedly raped.British parliamentarian Damian Collins, chairman of the influential Culture, Media and Sports Parliamentary Committee, said that there was a culture of avoiding the problem at the FA and the clubs."A picture is building up of people in football not having addressed the abuse and also may have turned their gaze away from it," he said.Giving credence to his view is the fact the FA dismissed with a terse "no comment" claims by Ian Ackley about abuse he suffered at the hands of serial offender and youth coach Barry Bennell in a Channel Four documentary in 1997.Such disdainful treatment of victims and also whistleblowers is of concern to Collins. Mourinho demands goals ..."Abuse is an incredibly serious problem and my concern is how does a victim or a whistleblower report it?" said the 42-year-old."Because often they are met with a response of 'do you have documentary evidence' and if you do not you're told you better keep your mouth shut."Greg Clarke, the recently elected chairman of the FA, which has launched an inquiry headed up by an eminent lawyer, does not believe there has been a cover-up but has conceded that a blind eye might have been turned to the stories of abuse."I think the moral consequences of failing to deal with some of these issues in the past we must get to the bottom of," he said on Tuesday.However, with revelations emerging on a daily basis the FA's image is taking a pounding.The BBC revealed this week that the FA scrapped a review into its Child Protection Programme two years into its existence in 2003 and the journalist who made the 1997 Channel Four documentary insists there is a 2005 FA report gathering dust which has 250 names of abused under-age footballers on it.Collins, for his part, said that if he and his committee are not satisfied by the reference points set by the FA for their inquiry then they will summon Clarke in the new year to appear before them."I am concerned the inquiry by the FA will be too narrowly focused on the claims themselves and not on the broader picture," said Collins."I'm worried the clubs will end up doing their own housework and it won't look at the broader cultural issues of how people got away with the abuse and will avoid posing pertinent questions."The FA are treading a path well-trodden in recent years by previously revered pillars or bedrocks of the establishment.
