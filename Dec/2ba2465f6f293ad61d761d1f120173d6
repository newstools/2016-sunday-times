I'm not talking about football and rugby derbies that wouldn't make a blip on the world radar.This is hardcore competition capable of rocking the planet to its molten core. The first one is in athletics.Remember Wayde van Niekerk saying he wants to drop down to include the 200m?The 400m Olympic and world champion is going to run straight into South Africa's 200m world championship bronze medallist Anaso Jobodwana, also holder of the 19.87sec national record. The 2016 sport successes SA will rememberHad Jobodwana not battled with injury this year, he would have won a medal at the Rio Olympics in August, where neither the silver nor bronze medallists dipped below 20 seconds.Last year, he and Van Niekerk attacked the South African 200m record like it was a ping-pong ball.Jobodwana started first, breaking Morne Nagel's mark of 20.11 and lowering it to 20.06 and soon afterwards 20.04.Then Van Niekerk broke the 20-second barrier, taking it to 19.94 before Jobodwana produced his current mark in the final of the world championships in Beijing, finishing third behind Usain Bolt and Justin Gatlin.And while Van Niekerk and Jobodwana are trading blows, they will have to watch out for fast-rising Akani Simbine.Fifth in the 100m by three-hundredths of a second at the Rio Games, Simbine couldn't run the 200m because Athletics SA didn't select him.The 23-year-old could have made the podium that night.Don't be fooled by his best time of 20.16 - he ran that an hour after lowering the South African 100m record to 9.89. He deliberately held back, especially on the bend.Simbine will dip below 20 seconds soon.And if the two young Olympians, Gift Leotlela and Clarence Munyai, keep getting faster, local athletics fans will be able to watch an Olympic final in their own backyard. And the 100m could be pretty exciting too, especially if Van Niekerk includes that in his routine.</img>Olympian Gift Leotlela sprints to victory in a race earlier this year.

Gold medal for buffoonery goes to Athletics SA for throwing away two possible medalsAs far as he was concerned, he was a genuine medal hope himself - even though he had never made the podium at the World Triathlon Series.And Schoeman was right.In a perfectly timed race he came out the water in the lead group, and comfortably trailed his more illustrious rivals on the bike before making his move in the run.Schoeman ended third while Murray, a weaker swimmer, forged his way up the field to end fourth just seven seconds behind.It was a brave effort considering Murray had broken his collarbone in April, an injury that had prevented him training in swimming for some six weeks.At the World Triathlon Series grand final in Mexico, Schoeman won after leader, Olympic champion Alistair Brownlee, stopped to help his ailing brother, Jonathan, over the line.Murray again finished fourth, this time 45 seconds behind Schoeman.With talk that Alistair is considering retirement, the next four years could see the South African duo hog the limelight at the top of the field.Roll on, 2017!
