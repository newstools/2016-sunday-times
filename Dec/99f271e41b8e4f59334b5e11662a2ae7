But for one Gauteng teen that special person was his mother.This week Coronationville Secondary School matriculant Moegsien Lala, 18, escorted his mother Suraya, 38, to his dance at Usambara Venue in Krugersdorp.Moegsien said the matric dance was an event that should be shared with someone special, and that person was his mother."She is the most special woman in my life and this was a special occasion. She ... will remain with me throughout my life," said Moegsien, who plans to study information technology.His girlfriend, Latifa Schoeman, thought it was a cute idea, said Moegsien."I decided I wanted to take my mother right from the beginning of the year. When I told her, she said the matric dance was not for her age. I told her if she didn't come as my partner, I wouldn't go. Eventually she agreed."Suraya, a recruitment consultant, said she was shocked by the invitation to the dance and thought it was a joke."I expected him to take his girlfriend," she said."I am glad I did go. It was such a wonderful and beautiful event. His teachers were very impressed and could not believe he brought his mother. When he introduced me to his friends they thought he was joking." Suraya wore a full-length nude and white dress covered in lace.She said she hoped to surprise Moegsien with a helicopter ride to the venue, but could not get landing clearance, so they arrived in a limousine.Suraya said he gave her the chance to feel like a princess."I did not attend my own matric dance as my parents could not afford it. And now my son gave me the opportunity," said the mother of four.Moegsien said he had had the opportunity to dance with his mother for the first time."Some of my friends could not believe it when we arrived together. We had a lot of fun. I wouldn't mind doing it again," he said.
