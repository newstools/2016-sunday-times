In the year 2023 people will be commuting between New York and London in a staggering three hours and 15 minutes, thanks to high-speed supersonic planes.That's the prediction anyway of Blake Scholl, CEO of the US-based aerospace start-up Boom, who recently announced the company had paired with Richard Branson and Virgin Galactic to work on a plane that, carrying 40 to 50-passengers, will fly at the speed of sound - almost three times faster than today's planes - and slice travel times approximately in half.While detractors point to the failure of the Concorde, which failed to endure despite similar capacities, Scholl makes a good point."We're getting better computers, better phones, and yet we're still flying, basically, these 1960s airplane designs," he says. "We've made planes safer, more efficient. But we haven't made it any easier to get around the planet."The only thing we're wondering is: which start-up is going to tackle the length of time it takes to get through airport security?
