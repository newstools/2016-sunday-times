Liverpool go into their final match of 2016 six points behind Chelsea at the top, but ahead of their opponents City, who occupy third place, a point behind.The two managers - Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola - last faced each other in April 2015 in the German Cup semifinal which went to penalties, whereupon Guardiola's Bayern Munich conspired to miss all four of theirs and Klopp's Borussia Dortmund went on to the final.On this occasion, Klopp said that he had been sent a text message from the club's sporting director, Michael Edwards, to let him know Guardiola was in the stadium, which seemed to prick the imagination of the Liverpool manager. Young Reds keeper has to man up, work harderWatching at Anfield from under the brim of a Baker-boy hat, Guardiola made a rare trip into enemy territory to see for himself what his old Bundesliga rival is building at Liverpool, ahead of their meeting.Having watched his team come from a goal behind to demolish Stoke City, even Klopp seemed surprised that Guardiola turned up in person on a bone-chilling night, four days before the big match."I'm not sure that he [Guardiola] watched a lot of games in the last few weeks in other stadiums of opponents," Klopp said. "That is a first sign it is a special game and we are already looking forward to it. It is a difficult game for both teams but exciting and the best thing is that it is at Anfield. They are an outstanding side, we are not too bad, so it will be a nice game."He joked that scouting opposition teams in person was no easy task because of the constant requests for autographs."Hopefully we had no security and Pep had to write all these autographs. Whatever I say tonight we cannot win the game but maybe I could say a few things that could make it more difficult. It is probably best I shut my mouth."In fact it was a game that attracted many of the great and good including the England manager Gareth Southgate, David Moyes and Steven Gerrard among others and Guardiola will be back on Saturday to try to find a way to beat a Liverpool side who have won their last three.Klopp jokingly suggested that Guardiola attended his Liverpool team's 4-1 win against Stoke to "watch good football".Asked in his post-match news conference about the Spaniard's attendance, Klopp said: "I respect them a lot, but I have not been to City's stadium this season or last to watch games. Maybe they want to watch good football." Guardiola's messianic status now in questionKlopp added: "We are already looking forward [to Manchester City]. It's a difficult game for both teams, but an exciting one."The best news for us is that it's at Anfield."Meanwhile, Guardiola believes that every game in the second half of the season will be like a cup final for his title hopefuls.An impressive and hard-earned 3-0 win at Hull kept pace with leaders Chelsea after Antonio Conte's side beat Bournemouth earlier on Monday.The Catalan admitted that the pressure was on following that result against Hull, but also conceded that such pressure will be routine for his side in the new year, especially with title rivals Chelsea and Liverpool not encumbered by having to play in European competition."Sometimes you play before, sometimes you play later," said Guardiola."But it doesn't matter whether you are seven points or 10 points behind when one team has won 12 in a row."We have one game to finish the first half of the season and then the second starts and it's like a final for us if we want to be there until the end of the season."Spurs out to stop BluesIn another mouthwatering clash on Wednesday, January 4, Chelsea's title credentials will be tested when they travel across London to White Hart Lane to play bitter rivals Tottenham Hotspur. Vardy and Foxes make light work of mighty CitizensProvided they win their home match against Stoke City tomorrow , the Blues will be out to claim a record 14 victories in a row against the Lily Whites at a ground that their fans once dubbed "Three Point Lane" because of the frequency with which they won there.That has changed, though.In a memorable match on New Year's Day this year, Spurs sunk Chelsea 5-3 after a stand-out performance by their talismanic striker Harry Kane,who seems to make a habit of scoring important goals in London derbies.Chelsea's fans noted that their side's record-breaking attempt, if it was to be, would come at White Hart Lane and they declared themselves delighted with the chance to write themselves into the history books at the Lane.Chelsea ended Tottenham's surge for the title last season with a 2-2 draw in a match that became known as "The Battle of Stamford Bridge" towards the end of last season, that saw nine of Spurs' young players yellow-carded after relinquishing a 2-0 lead at half time.Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino is unmoved by Chelsea's relentless run, seeing the match as nothing more than an opportunity to take points off the free-running log leaders."There are a lot of games to play. I think our position is good," the Spurs mentor said."We are in a position that we can attack the second half of the season and try to move up the table."
