Located 200km north of the Arctic Circle in Jukkasj rvi, the Icehotel has for 27 years opened for about four months each winter, during which visitors would flock there from more than 80 countries to spend a night in the eerie silence and -5 C chill.Each spring, the hotel has been left to melt, only to be rebuilt to a fresh blueprint the following year, using 5,000 tons of ice from the nearby River Torne.Now the hotel has announced plans to stay open year-round - another world first for ice hotels. 7 of the world's weird & wonderful floating hotelsThe Icehotel 365 will use solar-powered cooling technology to keep the hotel, which includes a bar, art gallery and 10 luxury suites, permanently open, enabling guests to experience such phenomena as the midnight sun and the northern lights.Sections of the hotel will continue to melt and be rebuilt as usual - meaning there will still be new, frozen artworks for guests to enjoy each year.On its website, the hotel describes what it's like to spend a night there."The snow has an insulating effect that makes it silent and tranquil, and when you switch off the lights, the room turns dark in a way that only people living in very remote areas experience these days."As for the cold, the trick is to keep your core temperature up, but slightly lower than normal.Guests get an expedition sleeping bag and there is a "survival course" held every evening at the hotel, where guides explain what to wear and how to use the sleeping bag to retain as much heat as possible.The bags are made for temperatures as low as -25 C but the temperature inside the hotel never drops below -5 C.In the morning, guests get a hot session in the sauna and a huge breakfast to get their blood pumping."Most people who stay in the hotel enjoy it," the website adds.
