Jammeh announced his "total rejection of the electoral results" as he addressed the West African nation on Friday on TV, citing voting irregularities. A new vote would be called for a later date, he said.On December 2, Jammeh said he would vacate the presidency after losing to Barrow in the previous day's vote, signalling the end of a 22-year rule since coming to power through a coup in 1994.Criticised by human rights groups for brutally stifling dissent, Jammeh got landslide victories in four previous polls.The US State Department condemned Jammeh's decision."This action is a reprehensible and unacceptable breach of faith with the people of Gambia," said Mark Toner, a State Department spokesman. It was "an egregious attempt to undermine a credible election process and remain in power illegitimately".The reversal came after courts in Gambia granted bail to opposition leaders who were serving sentences for participating in protests against Jammeh's rule.Barrow had already started laying out future policy over the past week, saying he'll nurture new international relations and review economic plans in a country where thousands of young people are trying to emigrate each year.Barrow said Jammeh had no authority to reject the poll results."I open up a channel of communication to convince him to facilitate a smooth transfer of executive powers in the supreme interest of this country," he said yesterday.Gambian authorities yesterday also refused entry to the chair of regional body Ecowas, Ellen Sirleaf Johnson, president of Liberia, dampening hopes for a political solution.The streets of Gambia's capital, Banjul, were calm yesterday, although some residents said they were staying at home for fear of violence.Johnson Sirleaf had hoped to put back on track Gambia's first democratic transition of power in over 50 years, but those plans appeared thwarted when her aircraft was denied landing access at Banjul."Johnson Sirleaf was supposed to fly in today, but Jammeh said 'Not at the moment'," said Senegal foreign minister Mankeur Ndiaye.It was not clear if the aircraft had already taken off.Johnson Sirleaf's camp was not immediately available for comment. A spokesman for Jammeh's government could not be reached.The AU also weighed in yesterday, calling Jammeh's statement "null and void".AU Commission chairwoman Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma said: "[I] strongly urge President Yahya Jammeh to facilitate a peaceful and orderly transition and transfer of power."She also called on Gambia's security forces to remain neutral.Meanwhile, the shellshocked camp of president-elect Barrow was holding an emergency meeting under heavy security in Banjul yesterday, two people said.The meeting was planning to make a statement sometime, they said."We are preparing ourselves," said a member of the Barrow camp, Isatou Touray."We condemn the statement from Jammeh."
