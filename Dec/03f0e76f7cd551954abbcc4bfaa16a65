Stars held Downs to 1-1 in a first half of yesterday's Premier Soccer League match played in sweltering heat, where Khama Billiat's 41st-minute opener was cancelled out by Thozani Sekotlong in the 43rd.Strikes in the 58th and 59th by Percy Tau and Keagan Dolly, respectively, then Tau again in the 79th, continued Sundowns' recent record of pastings of Stars. Before this match, the last three league and cup results were 6-1, 3-1 and 5-2, making it 18 goals in four matches.Ahead of Downs' departure tomorrow for the Club World Cup in Japan, coach Pitso Mosimane was without recent injury scares Anthony Laffor and Sibusiso Vilakazi, while pressing other key performers back into action.Dolly and Billiat were back from shin-splint injuries, and Leonardo Castro made his first start, reuniting the "CBD" front combination for the first time in a starting line-up since July in the Champions League.Stars coach Giovanni Solinas has introduced a number of young players for the resource-challenged Free State team, and brought back a notable resilience. Chippa add misery to Chiefs, Komphela seasonOf course, it was Sundowns who pushed at Stars' three-man centreback and two wing-back defence for much of the first half, Ea Lla Kotlo mostly containing one of Africa's fiercest club attacks quite well.From an early corner, Sundowns central defender Wayne Arendse headed over, then Billiat had a solid drive at goalkeeper Thela Ngobeni.In the 35th minute Dolly initiated an attack from his half on the left and, after a short passing combination on the edge of the area involving Castro and Billiat, was through down the middle to force a save from Ngobeni.If that move suggested the "CBD" was back, then, after Bokang Tlhone's header from a corner looped onto the crossbar for Stars, Downs' opener confirmed it.Billiat put Castro through into the box down the left, and he squared back to Billiat in space, the Zimbabwean slotting calmly past Ngobeni. Two minutes later, the impressive leftback Tlhone skipped down the left, freeing Sekotlong on the left of the box to curl a fine finish past Downs goalkeeper Denis Onyango.This was not quite the script Downs wanted. But if it was a display in class the Brazilians were looking for ahead of an event against world stars, they provided it early in the second half.When Sundowns turn it on, one can run out of superlatives to describe the sheer sexiness of it.Billiat's backheel put Tebogo Langerman into space on the left to cross for Tau, who seemed to hang in the air for the length of a flight to Japan before a classy headed connection past Ngobeni.Dolly played two one-twos - with Billiat and then Castro - to go through and slam in a third. Tau practically jogged in a fourth, beating Langelihle Ndlovu on the left and advancing to finish past Ngobeni.
