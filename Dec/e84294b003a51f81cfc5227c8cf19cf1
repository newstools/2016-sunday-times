It is an omen full of festive cheer for Antonio Conte's men as they were Premier League leaders at Christmas for each of their four title victories - 2004/05, 2005/06, 2009/10 and 2014/15.But the team top on Christmas Day has only gone on to win the championship 50% of the time in Premier League history - 12 out of 24.Arsenal were not top at Christmas for any of their three title wins in 1997/98, 2001/02 and 2003/04. At the other end of the table, there is bad news for Hull City fans. Having not been bottom all season, they dropped into that position this past weekend with a defeat at West Ham.The side bottom of the Premier League on Christmas Day have gone on to be relegated in 21 of 24 seasons - 87.5% of the time.Chelsea have played dazzling football during the 11-game winning streak (a club record) that has sent them clear at the top of the table, notably crushing Manchester United 4-0 and thrashing Everton 5-0 in a scintillating display last month.The Blues are once again playing with "fearsome intensity and steely focus", says Oliver Kay in The Times, singling out the influence of N'Golo Kante in midfield."The challenge for Chelsea now is to keep demonstrating that they are as good as Conte - and Kante - has made them look."Liverpool sent a message to the Premier League leaders that they are a force to reckon with.The Reds play Stoke City at home, on December 27, before Manchester City at Anfield four days later.City are a point behind Liverpool.There is broad agreement that Liverpool have the ability to challenge for the title, but it is their powers of endurance that left the deepest impression following their Merseyside derby victory on Monday night.Match-winner Sadio Man believes his injury-time goal proved J rgen Klopp's side have the staying power."It was a different type of win from us. That is good," said Man . "The most important thing was not how we played, but to have the win. We got it and we are going to keep going now."Much is different in this campaign to so many over the past 26 years for a club whose pursuit of the Premier League has become an obsession.It is not just that Liverpool have failed to win it, but they have rarely challenged. Only twice in the past 12 years have Liverpool been in the top two on Christmas day - the last time was three years ago when the side coached by Brendan Rodgers came so close.For Arsenal's supporters, their team's 2-1 defeat at title rivals Manchester City carried a troubling air of d j vu. Just as in their 2-1 loss at Everton, The Gunners took an early lead, only to wilt in the face of a second-half fightback, leaving manager Ars ne Wenger to rage vainly against refereeing decisions.Consecutive defeats have threatened to derail their season, leaving them nine points behind Chelsea and only a point ahead of fifth-placed Tottenham Hotspur.Wenger's team looked devoid of confidence and drive in Sunday's loss and failed to stand up to the physical challenge posed by Everton five days earlier.Dominant in the first half, they barely got out of their own half in the second as their defence struggled to repel waves of City attacks. After a run of just one goal in 11 matches, Zlatan Ibrahimovic has rediscovered his early season goal-scoring form for Manchester United, netting for the ninth and 10th times in nine outings in their 2-0 win at West Bromwich Albion.Speaking before the match, the 35-year-old said: "I feel like a 20-year-old boy."Manager Jos Mourinho admitted before the match that Ibrahimovic's "phenomenal" form made it difficult to drop him. But with a busy festive period looming, Ibrahimovic is likely to be rested at some point.United, meanwhile, are already hoping Mourinho remains as manager beyond the end of his three-year contract as they are delighted with his impact at Old Trafford.Despite pushing Leicester City hard in the Premier League title race last season, few pundits expect Tottenham to go one better and lift the trophy in May, but manager Mauricio Pochettino's side showed they should not be ruled out of the running after a spirited 2-1 win over Burnley this week.Tottenham are now a point behind the top four and, although leaders Chelsea are 10 points further ahead, a lot can still change over the busy Christmas period.sub_head_startUpcoming fixtures sub_head_endMonday, December 26Watford v Crystal Palace; Leicester City v Everton; Manchester United v Sunderland; Burnley v Middlesbrough; Arsenal v West Bromwich Albion; Swansea City v West Ham United ; Hull City v Manchester City; Chelsea v Bournemouth.Tuesday, December 27Liverpool v Stoke City.Wednesday, December 28Southampton v Tottenham Hotspur.- AFP, The Daily Telegraph, London, The Week and BBC
