NONKE. Who knew that a single word could cause such a storm and take on so many meanings?Nonke - Zulu for "all of you" - was one of many hashtags that kept the twitterati entertained, informed and sometimes annoyed in 2016.For millions of Twitter users, #Nonke became one of the hottest hashtags, starting nasty personal spats and spawning T-shirts.In March, DJ Euphonik tweeted #Nonke to end a tirade after users accused him of shading rapper AKA in a tweet in which he said music was "about bars, not cars".The tweet came soon after AKA posted a picture of his new car on Instagram.When he was accused of hating the rapper because he couldn't get over his ex, Bonang Matheba, the DJ threw a tantrum. Euphonik said he had not meant to offend anyone with his tweets, but was aiming at "trolls that insist on being all up in my business". He signed with the hashtag #NONKE.That is an episode we all want to forget.Twitter and several hashtags have dominated conversations this year. King Monada's house track Ska Bhora Moreki inspired several tweets about the "moreki": the person who has all the money and therefore holds the power in social settings.The hashtag #WhenMoreki spawned memes about situations where the "moreki" would exercise his power around his broke friends.Continuing with music's inspiration on tweets, the EFF released a house track called Zupta Must Fall, inspired by its own hashtag, #ZuptaMustFall. The hashtag #Zupta was also a hot topic - in response to the president's relationship with the wealthy family.The Guptas also dominated social media conversations.Hashtags such as #StateCapture trended, especially after the public protector's State of Capture report said the then Eskom CEO, Brian Molefe, frequently visited the Guptas' Saxonwold compound. Molefe denied this, and claimed at a media conference that the reason for his being in Saxonwold could have been a shebeen.This gave birth to the hashtag #SaxonwoldShebeen. People spent hours trying to find out why they had never heard of a shebeen in the swanky suburb.Even the City of Johannesburg's Twitter account joined in the fun, saying it was "noting #SaxonwoldShebeen as one of the hidden gems of Jozi".Politics were also much discussed in the twittersphere, especially around the local government elections.Before the elections, ANC supporters tweeted, using the hashtag #Asinavalo, which was the party's slogan for the municipal elections. Meaning "we have no fear", the hashtag was used by those who believed that the party would do well come voting time.But after the ANC lost not only Nelson Mandela Bay but also Tshwane and Johannesburg, detractors started using the hashtag #Uvalo and #Sinovalo (we have fear) because, as it turned out, the party did have reason to be scared.President Zuma gets roasted on Twitter #poorbaba The president was one of the main political figures to occupy Twitter users, with #StateCapture and the public protector's #StateCaptureReport being two serious topics. People also had fun at President Jacob Zuma's expense by using the hashtag #PoorBaba after the ANC national executive committee decided not to recall him last month.The hashtag was a twist on #PoorMichelle, which pokes fun at Michelle Williams, the least famous member of Beyonc 's R&amp;B group Destiny's Child.The #PoorBaba tweets captioned pictures of the president to make it look as if he were caught in awkward social situations.On a more serious note, the way society harms women was also a talking point. This was highlighted by the four women who staged a silent protest while Zuma addressed the Independent Electoral Commission following the voting.The four held posters that read "Remember Khwezi", "I am 1 in 3", "Khanga", "#" and "10 yrs later", alluding to the rape charge on which Zuma was acquitted.The protest sparked two popular hashtags: #RememberKhwezi, after the woman who had accused Zuma, and #1in3, where mostly women shared their experiences of sexual assault and sexual violence.The #1in3 referred to the often disputed claim that one in three women in South Africa will be raped in their lifetimes.Another hashtag that struck a nerve was #MenAreTrash, originally a response to gender-based violence, patriarchy, sexism and misogyny.It targeted men who refused to admit that a sexist society harmed women.It was also used to attack men who allowed their boys to get away with locker-room talk: tweeters claimed these men were just as guilty as those who bragged about grabbing women's privates (hello, Donald Trump and Co).The #FeesMustFall hashtag (and its opposition #TakeWitsBack) dominated in 2016, just as it had the year before.Race also kept people talking.The first prominent hashtag of the year was #TheYearWeMispronounceBack, where black Twitter users said they would take revenge on white people who did not bother to pronounce African names properly. It was started by a user named @Spoonkz, who tweeted: "2016 is the year for acting like you don't know how to pronounce white peoples names."The tweets that followed led to people saying they would turn Jonathan into Jabulani, Samantha into Simnikiwe and Luke into Lungile.On a more serious note, racism became a hot topic when the pupils of Pretoria Girls' High School protested against the policing of black and brown people's hair at the school.The hashtag #StopRacismAtPretoriaGirlsHigh gained traction not only in South Africa, but across the globe as black US media picked up on the protest. Girls' High teachers face disciplinary action after racism allegationsOn a more positive note, Twitter (and the internet in general) was flooded with people speaking about #BlackGirlMagic and #BlackExcellence as a means of self-affirmation and self love.After Wayde van Niekerk's world record-breaking gold medal run in the 400m at the Rio Olympics, the hashtag #ColouredExcellence started trending. People shared their joy in having a coloured South African making headlines for all the right reasons, rather than the usual media portrayals of coloured people as gangsters and criminals.Predictably, others began complaining that this was "not about race" and it was a "South African victory" rather than a "coloured victory".Van Niekerk himself weighed in, saying he represented all South Africans, not one racial group.With the ANC set to elect a new leader next year, it's safe to assume that Zuma will inspire plenty more hashtags.
