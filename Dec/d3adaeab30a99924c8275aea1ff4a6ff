Michelle Acton, principal consultant at financial services company Old Mutual Corporate Consultants, has this advice when it comes to choosing an umbrella fund for employees: Take the time to compare which model - a set cost per member or a percentage of salary, for example - will be the most beneficial for your employees. This will depend on the average salary and the number of members, among other things.While charging a fixed rand fee per member per month is generally quite benign in terms of impact on retirement savings, the fees charged as a percentage of payroll are helpful to avoid lower-income members carrying a relatively heavier burden in terms of fees; The amount of flexibility and customisation within the umbrella fund will affect the costs. It is important to try to compare like with like - while a single fee might seem appealing and simpler, it might also be more expensive for some members' benefits; Keeping costs as low as possible is important, but a well-informed decision must be made in the end. Making a good decision that makes sense for members is always a fine balance between quality of service, flexibility of options and cost. The most important thing that an employer can do is gain a thorough understanding of the services offered, along with their associated costs. - Margaret Harris
