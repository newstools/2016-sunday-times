A proposal to suspend him - for flouting Sascoc's constitution because he allegedly remains on the Volleyball SA (VSA) executive - will be made when the newly elected board meets for the first time tomorrow, a member said yesterday.The member, who asked not to be named, said Reddy was the honorary life president of VSA, adding it was an executive position in his case.Changes to the Sascoc constitution in 2014 included a clause preventing the president and CEO from holding board positions on national sports bodies."[The VSA constitution] says the honorary life president is an executive member and then goes further to state that [he] also serves on [the] management committee," said the board member."Some sort of remedial action needs to be taken against volleyball as well as the CEO for flouting the constitution for so long ... some disciplinary action needs to be taken."Reddy, who stepped down as VSA president earlier this year after an unbroken tenure dating back to 1994, said he'd heard there was a move against him, but denied the charge."I'm an honorary life president for the services I've given to volleyball. I'm not an active sitting member."I have a contract, I have a position, I have a job description and there's a constitution ."I'm actually waiting to see how they can manipulate the constitution to find a way against me."
