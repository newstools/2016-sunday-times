The striker scored the game's only goal at the end of the first half in another commanding performance from Chelsea in which they limited what attacking aspirations Alan Pardew's side had, in the first half in particular.Costa was booked for the fifth time this season, and so too midfielder N'Golo Kante, which means both are suspended for the December 26 home game against Bournemouth. Zim tycoon at the helm as Jordaan pulls out of Cosafa raceThe cynical view is that perhaps Conte believed he could spare them for that game which, if Chelsea won, would see them within two games of Arsenal's Premier League record of 14 straight wins in 2002.At full-time Chelsea were nine points clear at the top of the table and, with Eden Hazard and Nemanja Matic back in the side, they look as unbreakable as ever.It was not a disastrous performance by Palace, but aside from two first-half chances, they barely laid a glove on Chelsea.Costa's headed goal came right at the end of a solid half from the home side and after the break they found it hard to put Conte's team under sustained pressure.They had been doing a decent job until one minute before the end of the regulation 45, when Palace permitted Hazard to raise his head and stroke a pass into the stride of Cesar Azpilicueta on the right and suddenly the home team were in trouble.Palace were retreating quickly but nowhere near quick enough for Scott Dann to be able to get into position to challenge Costa, who was waiting for the ball in front of him from Azpilicueta.When it came Dann could barely turn himself round in time to see Costa flight his header over Wayne Hennessey and into the far corner of the Palace goal.Before then Pardew's 4-1-4-1 formation - no concession from him to switch to a three-man defence - had done enough to stifle Chelsea in midfield and Palace had made two good chances of their own.Both came down Chelsea's left side and both were crossed from Martin Kelly, the first volleyed wide by Jason Puncheon and the second headed wide by James McArthur. Red Devils start to believeIn the second half it was Chelsea who created the better chances and Marcos Alonso struck the bar with a free kick. With five minutes of time added on at the end, Palace roused themselves for one last effort, but a free kick skied by substitute Andros Townsend was a fair indication of how little they had threatened the Chelsea goal.Costa scored his 13th league goal of the season to extend his lead on the goal scorers' chart.He has now scored 50 goals for Chelsea in all competitions. Yesterday he scored Chelsea's first headed goal of the season.Conte's side have 43 points from 17 games, nine more than second-placed Liverpool and Arsenal, who will attempt to narrow the deficit. Arsenal play Manchester City today and Liverpool take on Everton in a Merseyside derby tomorrow.Palace have won just once in their last 11 league games and remained three points above the relegation zone.- The Daily Telegraph, London
