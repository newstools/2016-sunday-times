The explosive revelations from the second part of Richard McLaren's report into state-sponsored doping by Russia before, during and after London 2012 and Sochi 2014 sent shockwaves through sport this weekend as the staggering scale of the cheating was laid bare.That shock gave way to anger as senior figures from the world of sport queued up to demand the strongest possible sanctions, including banning the country from Pyeongchang 2018 and London 2017 and from hosting any major event until it could admit its crimes and clean up its act. 'Banned' sports codes find straight and narrow 'Banned' sports codes now on the straight and narrowThe International Olympic Committee refused to expel Russia from this summer's Olympics amid pressure to do so following the publication of the first part of the McLaren report, including from the president of the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada), Craig Reedie.Reedie, Britain's most senior sporting official, has said that the IOC "may" now impose the ultimate sanction.The furore surfaced after it emerged that Russia hijacked international sport by using more than 1,000 athletes in an "institutional conspiracy" to win medals at the Sochi and London Olympics and other global events.Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, who has previously accused Russia of "state-sponsored" cheating, said in a new report for Wada that he had confirmed the switching of samples at the Sochi Winter Olympics in 2014 and that salt and coffee were used to manipulate samples.More than 1,000 athletes in the summer and winter Olympics and Paralympics "can be identified as being involved in or benefiting from manipulations to conceal positive testing", his report said."A cover-up that evolved over the years from uncontrolled chaos to an institutionalised and disciplined medal-winning strategy and conspiracy," McLaren said as he introduced his report.Russia's sports ministry again denied state backing for doping.
