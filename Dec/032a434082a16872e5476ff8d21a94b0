The pair bagged all of South Africa's five medals at the recent world short-course championships in Windsor, Canada, once again carrying the nation on their broad shoulders.Competing over 25m laps, Le Clos bagged three gold and a silver while Van der Burgh added a gold.The last time a South African swimmer, apart from these two, won a medal in an Olympic event at these championships was in 2008. Giulio Zorzi out to join Cameron van der Burgh on podiumAnd the last South African swimmers to make the podium at the world long-course championships, in Olympic-sized 50m pools, were Roland Schoeman and Ryk Neethling in 2005.That's not counting the likes of Gerhard Zandberg and Giulio Zorzi who have made the top three in the 50m backstroke and 50m breaststroke, but those events are not on the Olympic menu.Four superstars and that's it. Not even a fluke or a one-hit wonder.So what does the future look like without Le Clos and Van der Burgh?National head coach Graham Hill is positive, saying he believes the next Olympic cycle could see the return of strong female swimmers.There's a group of them, from 14 to 17, who have the potential to take South Africa into international battle again.No women qualified for the South African Olympic team this year."I think we've got a whole new batch waiting," Hill said, referring also to the men. "We can't just keep relying on Chad and Cameron."Hill's job as national coach for the next four years would include working closely with other coaches and ensuring that they get the best out of their swimmers.He pointed out that the largely young contingent in Canada had performed well, with the likes of Eben Vorster, Neil Fair and Tayla Lovemore achieving personal bests, and others like Mariella Venter and Gabi Grobler getting close to their best times.Other promising swimmers weren't there, like US-based students Chris Reid, the backstroker who disappointed in Rio, and Zane Waddell, a freestyle sprinter.New Swimming SA president Alan Fritz said the country's coaches needed to be included in a national system."Every coach does his own thing. We need to drive a national coaching philosophy," he said.Fritz added that he had met at least 12 South African coaches as well as retired legend Penny Heyns and Schoeman."There's got to be a system where they feed back into it," he said.</img> Breastroke champion Cameron van den Burgh powers his way to victory in a previous 50 m race.
