Trading was choppy for most of the day as the market sought direction from S&amp;P Global Ratings announcement on Friday and Italian voters decision on Sunday to reject prime minister Matteo Renzi s constitutional reform plans with a large majority raising questions about Italy s continued EU membership.S&amp;P lowered SA s long-term local-currency rating to BBB from BBB+ while the foreign-currency rating was left unchanged at BBB- both with a negative outlook. South Africans can head into the festive season feeling a bit more at ease knowing that the country has maintained its investment grade rating said Old Mutual multi-managers investment strategist Dave Mohr.Looking to 2017 he said the bigger risk to local bond markets remained US interest rate developments. Higher US interest rates would likely result in a stronger dollar which could result in a weaker rand putting upward pressure on local inflation and interest rates Mohr said.The firmer rand was the main driving force on the day with the local currency reaching R13.79/$ in late afternoon trade thereby supporting retailers and banks.European markets were higher following the rejection of the right-wing candidate in the Austrian presidential election and despite the turmoil in Italy.The gold price had dropped 1% to $1 164 an ounce in the late afternoon while platinum was 0.90% higher at $934 an ounce. Brent oil had risen 1.42% to $55.16 an barrel.The all share closed 0.93% higher at 49 713.60 points and the blue-chip top 40 added 0.86%. General retailers lifted 3.23% and food and drug retailers rose 2.95%. Banks added 1.95% and financials ended the day 1.06% higher. Platinums rose 0.94% while the gold index slumped 4.46%.The Dow Jones industrial average opened 0.45% higher at record levels. In European markets the FTSE 100 had gained 0.29% the French CAC 40 had risen 0.81% and Germany s Dax 30 was up 1.35%.Absa Asset Management investment strategist Errol Shear said an expected ratings downgrade had already largely been priced into markets although an actual downgrade by S&amp;P would most likely have resulted in an aggressive sell-off of the rand.He said while it was good news that SA avoided its foreign-currency credit rating downgraded to junk status all three major ratings agencies still had SA on a negative outlook. This means a lot of work needs to be done and credibility [needs] to be regained if SA is to avoid a downgrade in 2017 Shear said.Among individual shares Anglo American rose 1.64% to R215.59 and Glencore added 1.67% to R49.97 after saying last week it would distribute $1bn to investors next year.Sasol rose 1.75% to R366.35 on the higher oil price.Kumba Iron Ore jumped 6.01% to R167.50.Barloworld rose 4.15% to R109.99.Harmony Gold fared worst in its sector plummeting 7.59% to R29.20.
