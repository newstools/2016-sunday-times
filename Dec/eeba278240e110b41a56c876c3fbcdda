This week the father of three from Johannesburg was removed as a director of Geffen International Realty Franchises. Rohde was also suspended as CEO of the company shortly after he was arrested for the murder of his wife Susan.The couple attended a company convention at Spier wine estate in Stellenbosch in July. Susan's body was found in the bathroom of their hotel room.The Sunday Times previously reported that Rohde allegedly had an affair with Cape Town estate agent Jolene Alterskye, who is a witness in the case.Samantha Bartlett, spokeswoman for Sotheby's International Realty South Africa, which is affiliated with the Lew Geffen property empire, said Rohde had been "removed as a director of Geffen International Realty Franchises" on Tuesday. "The company views this process as an internal matter."Asked about further action, Bartlett said the "board will meet and determine a way forward".Rohde's attorney, Nicole Ross, said he would challenge the "lawfulness of his suspension" at the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration on December 15.She said Rohde would also go to the high court to review his removal as a director because it was not in compliance with the Companies Act. He had been removed for "no apparent reason", Ross said."A board meeting chaired by Mr Lew Geffen was purportedly called by the directors," she said."Mr Rohde made compelling representations, personally and through his legal representatives, to his capacity to carry out his duties as a director and CEO of the company, [but] the company failed to consider these representations at all," Ross said."Prior to the resolution to remove him being passed, the company, as represented by Mr Geffen, on record advised that a decision had already been made to remove Mr Rohde as a director."Ross said Rohde "fully intends pursuing other remedies", including an action for damages.Rohde, who is out on bail of R100,000, is due back in the Stellenbosch Magistrate's Court next month.During his bail application it emerged that his net worth is about R30-million and he has a monthly income of R155,000.
