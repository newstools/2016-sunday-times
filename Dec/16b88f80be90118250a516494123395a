Pantone 15-0343 is described as a "life-affirming" shade of green foliage, grass and green apples that evokes the first days of spring and the pursuit of personal passions and vitality."Greenery bursts forth in 2017 to provide us with the hope we collectively yearn for amid a complex social and political landscape," said Leatrice Eiseman, Executive Director of the Pantone Color Institute."Satisfying our growing desire to rejuvenate, revitalize and unite, Greenery symbolizes the reconnection we seek with nature, one another and a larger purpose." Greenery follows Serenity and Rose Quartz, which were the colors of 2016."The tangy yellow-green speaks to our desire to express, explore, experiment and reinvent, imparting a sense of buoyancy," said Eiseman."Through its reassuring yet assertive vibrancy, Greenery offers us self-assurance and boldness to live life on our own terms, during a time when we are redefining what makes us successful and happy."
