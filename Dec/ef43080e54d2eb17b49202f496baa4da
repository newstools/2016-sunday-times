Lauder, Executive Chairman at The Est e Lauder Companies, saying: "More than two decades ago, we met an extremely creative makeup artist with a revolutionary idea that changed the way women feel about beauty. That idea grew into a highly successful, global beauty brand. Bobbi will always be part of our Est e Lauder Companies family and we wish her the very best in the future."The brand, which was founded in 1991 in the form of a range of lipsticks, is known for its natural approach to beauty, summed up by its mantra, 'be who you are'.
