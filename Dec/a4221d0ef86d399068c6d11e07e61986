The KwaZulu-Natal student teacher said she was giving up teaching for now to focus on building a career as a performer.But before she does, she'll be throwing a "little class party" for her pupils, to thank them for their support and for pushing her to enter the singing competition."Idols was not on my to-do list for the year; the push was just what I needed," an excited Khumalo said this week. "The children, and the message of perseverance," had helped her through the contest. "I needed to prove that hopes and dreams can become a reality," she said, adding that she would return to teaching "later in my life".On Sunday night the 22-year-old broke the seven-year male domination of the competition, beating fellow finalist Thami Shobede by 50000 votes of the 14million cast for the finale."I always knew that it was a 50/50 chance, however, I always felt like he had the upper hand and the audience was a lot more familiar with him. When I heard my name I almost didn't believe it! I was filled with extreme excitement," said Khumalo."This week has been super busy, but extremely fun."The "shy" teacher first auditioned in Durban's Playhouse in January, where she sang US singer Janelle Mon e's hit, PrimeTime.Khumalo, who lives with her parents and younger brother, featured in the first episode on July 17, which focused on the auditions. She immediately stole the hearts of viewers when her story aired.More than 10000 people auditioned for this season's competition, braving long queues across the country in the hope of clinching a golden ticket.In its debut month, 1.1million viewers tuned in, according to the Broadcast Research Council of South Africa. And Mzansi Magic said more than 83million votes had been cast throughout the season.</img> SA Idols finalists Thami Shobede and Noma Khumalo.
