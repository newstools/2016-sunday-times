Maxwell, 28, this week said he felt as though batting below Wade at No6 for Victoria in the domestic Sheffield Shield cricket hurt his selection chances for Australia's third test against South Africa in Adelaide last week.Captain Steve Smith and Australia's leadership party fined Maxwell for what they termed his "disrespectful" comments towards his state skipper and ODI teammate Wade.Head coach Darren Lehmann said Maxwell's words in a media conference were "disappointing", leading to Smith and Australia's senior members to impose a fine on him."Everyone was disappointed in his comments," Smith told reporters yesterday."I've expressed that to him myself and spoke to the team. One of our values is respect and having respect for your teammates, opposition, the fans, the media. Hash-tag whither the Amla magic?"I thought what he said was very disrespectful to a teammate and his Victorian captain. The leadership group got together and we decided to fine Glenn. We thought that was a sufficient punishment."Although Maxwell was fined, he is available for selection for today's opening match in the three-game Chappell-Hadlee Trophy ODI series at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG).Smith said Maxwell was "shattered" when he heard his punishment."I don't think he [Maxwell] thought the words came out the way they actually did," Smith said. "We've moved on from that now."Maxwell said he lamented batting below Wade in Victoria's batting order, saying it hindered his selection chances."I think probably batting below the wicketkeeper is also a bit painful as well," Maxwell said on Thursday. "The wicketkeeper should be batting at seven unless you're trying to squeeze an extra bowler into your line-up."New Zealand have hinted they may unleash firebrand speedster Lockie Ferguson against Australia. Skipper Kane Williamson was giving little away yesterday about the make-up of his final XI, but the SCG pitch is expected to favour the quicks early."He sent a couple of messages at training," Williamson said of Ferguson. "He bowled really nicely so we'll have to wait and see."He bowls quick and run in and bumped me a few times which was great. It's what you want to face and it's fantastic preparation."- AFP
