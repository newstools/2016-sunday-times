Want more Westworld but don't fancy reading the Michael Crichton novel? Fear not, Crichton's book was based on this earlier, multi-award-winning film which marked his debut as a film director. The concept is the same (though there are three theme park worlds instead of one) and the robots still go rogue, but the film focuses more on how park visitors try to escape after an uprising begins.WATCH the trailer for the original Westworld movie Just as Michael Crichton made his directorial debut with Westworld, novelist Alex Garland did the same with Ex Machina, also recipient of numerous accolades, with Alicia Vikander (The Danish Girl), Oscar Isaac (Star Wars: The Force Awakens), Domhnall Gleeson (Harry Potter franchise,) and Sonoya Mizuno (La La Land) as its principal actors.WATCH the trailer for Ex Machina For a similarly-titled film, also about the consciousness of a female cyborg called Ava but made on a tenth of the budget of Ex Machina, see 2013 indie thriller The Machine, starring Toby Stephens of Black Sails and Bond film Die Another Day and Caity Lotz of Mad Men, Arrow and Legends of Tomorrow.WATCH the trailer for The Machine Britt Robertson leads as the teen who, following a trail of clues, discovers the way to a futuristic city created by the world's most brilliant inventors. Directed by Brad Bird (The Incredibles) and co-starring George Clooney, Hugh Laurie, and a revelatory Raffey Cassidy, its storyline was found wanting but cast performances and the film's sheen make it worth checking out all the same.WATCH the trailer for Tomorrowland Humankind has been decimated by a war with the Cylons, robotic beings that they themselves created, and who have re-engineered themselves to look, act, and in some cases believe that they are really human. Over the course of its five-year revival, Battlestar Galactica collected three Emmys and seven Saturn Awards; follow-up Caprica dumped the war setting to provide a more broadly accessible entry point. WATCH a trailer for Battlestar Galactica If Westworld was about humanoid AIs in a theme park, this ongoing series (and its 2012 Swedish original kta m nniskor or Real Humans) asks what would happen if AIs gained self-awareness and self-determination in a domestic setting. A British-American production with a cast to match, Humans has been very well received, just like its inspiration.WATCH the trailer for Humans
