Overstrand municipality confirmed this week that it had reissued a tender for a large restaurant development at Fick's Pool near the town centre.It is one of the country's oldest tidal pools and was a rare "non-white" coastal facility during apartheid.A previous tender to develop the site was withdrawn five years ago after criticism from some quarters, and due to the fact that the sole bidder did not proceed with the project. At the time it was feared that development of the site could result in the privatisation of public space.The municipality insisted this week that public access was one of the conditions of the latest tender."Access to the site and ablution facilities remain open for the public," said director of infrastructure and planning Stephen M ller.The successful bidder would be responsible for maintaining the site, which has fallen into partial neglect."The tender still needs to be evaluated. The benefit, however, lies in the proper maintenance and upkeep of the area and to be a true tourist attraction," said M ller."The jobs created by the restaurant, maintenance and upkeep of the area and the rental income are added bonuses."The development will include: A 266m restaurant and kitchen; 65m of terraces and decks; and 8,000m of parking.The Western Cape department of environmental affairs and development planning said public access was a condition of the Fick's Pool project environmental authorisation, originally granted in 2010."The conditions of the environmental authorisation clearly entrench the right of the public to access Fick's Pool," said Ieptieshaam Bekko of the department's coastal management division."Should public access to Fick's Pool be prohibited, it will constitute a breach of condition of the environmental authorisation as well as provisions of the Integrated Coastal Management Act."In 2011, ANC councillors raised concerns about the Fick's Pool development, claiming it contravened the municipality spatial development framework.At the time, ANC councillor Maurencia Gillion said disturbing Fick's Pool would not be in the interests of the wider Hermanus community."How many more restaurants do we need in Hermanus? There are already 42. This [plan] would be the same as demolishing the old harbour in Hermanus."
