A few tips for beginners?Soil health is the foundation of your garden. Make sure you have rich, well-nurtured soil that drains easily and is protected from the elements. Use your garden waste and kitchen organics to make compost - a worm farm is a great investment for this.My advice is to persevere and persist - gardening has a long-term growth curve and often a long-term return on investment. That said, you will be constantly rewarded along the way.Get seasonal seedlings delivered right to your veggie patchThree herbs every garden should have?If you like Eastern cuisine, plant mint, coriander and curry leaf.

In fact, my garden is in constant flux because of this.One piece of advice I can give is to create your vegetable garden in a way that it can be covered with a protective net in winter (or during summer holidays) to protect from hungry birds. Design is key - think ahead of how you want to use the space so that you don't have to retrospectively move things around.If you have a small vegetable or herb garden, place it close to your house because when it's in full swing it will need daily attention. I also wish I had paid more attention to my fruit trees in the early days as they are much more giving when maintained every season.
