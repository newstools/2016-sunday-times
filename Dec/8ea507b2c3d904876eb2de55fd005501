He was 72. He became a household name with his customers as they could see on TV the CEO of their favourite supermarket recalled Anthony Chait the CEO of Zeridium a specialist tax and exchange control consultancy. Trolley for trolley you don't pay more was the crafty catch-line from Weil who was happily wheeling a shopping cart along the grocery aisles in the 80s. The ad helped rescue Checkers which was teetering on the edge of insolvency. But Weil's bulky appearance and slight lisp also made the twolley-for-twolley man a subject of derision and brought him unwanted attention. Chait said his death was a great loss in the corporate sector. Retail was his game. He consulted in his personal capacity in the retail space. He was a very low key a very low profile personality. Chait said Weil died suddenly after complications following surgery to his colon. His funeral took place in Johannesburg on Sunday morning. Weil who was born in Port Elizabeth on November 30 1944 started work with the department of planning in Pretoria in 1969 for five months. According to the interview he had with Financial Mail in 2007 he couldn't stand the estrangement as the the only English-speaker and a Jew and repelled by the stultifying futility of apartheid planning. He joined Tiger Oats in Durban. His first break came in 1976 when Tiger sent him to Randfontein as CEO of the ailing SA Oil Mills. From 1989-93 Clive served as executive chairman of the Game Discount Store Division of Prefcor Group. Previously Weil served as MD of Checkers a 200 store supermarket chain that he successfully restructured.
