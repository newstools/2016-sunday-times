Sam Kennedy of Johannesburg, who worked for nearly four decades in the schoolwear industry, said the savings could be enormous if schools went the simple route."I can understand some schools wanting some sort of uniqueness. As soon as they go that route they are inviting short production lines, which are very expensive. A basic white shirt can be produced in the thousands at a fraction of the cost of those that are unique," he said.Kennedy suggested that every school should have white boys' shirts, grey flannels and a black or navy blazer. Dad puts foot down: no new school uniforms"Certain schools want exclusivity to reflect. I am sure many of the schools' governing bodies wanting uniqueness are not aware of the complexity they are inviting. They are not looking at the costs."He said the larger the production runs, the greater the economies of scale to be had, including on fabric purchasing, pattern-making, laying up, sewing, finishing and pressing, packaging and delivery.David Walker, owner of McCullagh &amp; Bothwell, said grey shorts or longs and white shirts were common to a lot of schools, but some chose to have a separate identity and branding. The company stocks about 100 different uniforms, for no-fee schools to the most expensive schools in the country.He said the local manufacturing industry had been decimated."There is a limited industry locally. All our school uniforms are made locally. It is hard to find quality suppliers who can deliver good-quality products on time. And it is a very competitive industry," said Walker.He acknowledged that there was truth to the findings of the Competition Commission that there was dodgy behaviour in the uniform industry. He said he had never been involved in bribery and had never seen it first-hand."But I am 100% sure it happens. There are corrupt people around. I am the only supplier to certain schools, where I have agreements. I consulted competition lawyers to ensure we are compliant with the competition law."
