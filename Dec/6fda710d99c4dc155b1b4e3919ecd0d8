The biggest stumbling block to emerging-market appeal is likely to stem from Donald Trump's inauguration as US president on January 20. Locally, political events in the run-up to the ANC's elective conference next December, at which a successor to President Jacob Zuma could be selected, will be closely watched.Nedbank economist Isaac Matshego is expecting the rand to draw some support from firmer commodity prices, "fluctuating between R14/$ and R14.50/$ for most of next year".But any improvement or deterioration in growth, as well as political developments, will influence the currency significantly, he said.Rabobank currency strategist Piotr Matys said emerging-market currencies were "looking increasingly vulnerable against the US dollar due to the prospect of a faster pace of tightening by the Fed."Trump's promise of fiscal stimulus, which included infrastructure spending to revitalise the US economy, and the prospect of higher inflation leading to rising interest rates in the US, has already shifted investor attention from higher-yielding but riskier emerging markets.This month the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 25 basis points to 0.75%, with the prospect of two - or possibly three - more hikes next year.Matys said analysis showed that the tightening cycle was likely to end in early 2020. Juggling your investments in a world of uncertainty But some analysts, like Rabobank's Fed watcher Philip Marey, are sceptical that the Fed will sustain a steep tightening pace next year. He expected only one hike in 2017.In response, investors have snapped up US bonds. The US 10-year bond is trending above expectations.Matys said: "It is fair to assume that we are witnessing a reversal towards the 2014 high at 3.05%. This does not bode well for emerging-market currencies."But he also believed that the dollar could run out of steam next year, because market expectations of aggressive rate hikes might not be realised."It is worth recalling that in December 2015, the Fed intended to raise rates four times this year, and we have seen only one hike."He said one factor that would mitigate against three hikes by the Fed was an imposition of trade barriers by the Trump administration.However, Matshego said, developments in the US could take a back seat next year if the Italian banking crisis triggered another global financial meltdown.Meanwhile, David Rees, senior markets economist at London-based research consultancy Capital Economics, said emerging-market equities rose 7% on the MSCI Emerging Markets index this year.This had "broadly matched the performance of the MSCI World index of developed-market equities", he said.A recovery of emerging-market currencies had ensured that equities "delivered more impressive returns in US dollar terms".The better performance of emerging-market equities this year was supported by an easing of fears about China's slowing growth and its currency, and the recovery in commodity prices."Emerging-market stock markets are unlikely to have it so easy in 2017," Rees said. "We doubt that the Fed will be so reluctant to raise rates."But he said Trump's policies were shrouded in mystery, there were still political risks in Europe, and China's growth might slow again next year."All of this suggests to us that the rally in emerging-market equities will remain on hold in the near term. But we think a major sell-off is unlikely."In a research report, Macquarie Capital analysts said it continued to "raise our demand forecasts for most metals and bulk commodities into 2017".This would be supported by a recovery in global manufacturing and Chinese construction activity.
