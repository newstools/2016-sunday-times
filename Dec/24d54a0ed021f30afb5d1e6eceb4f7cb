The Nelson Mandela Foundation s name is being used in a new phishing scam doing the rounds the latest in a string of scams targeting job seekers."In an attempt to gather sensitive personal information from unsuspecting members of the community the scam artists approach people via SMS or internet chat sites. A suggestion is made that you apply for a position as the Foundation s ambassador in South Korea. The salary offered is between $30 000 and $50 000 a month and the victim is asked for their CV."The Nelson Mandela Foundation has offices in Johannesburg only and is not offering any such position anywhere."The foundation has had to issue several similar cautionary alerts about scams.In June the foundation was made aware of a scam also calling for job applications.The poorly worded advert then read:"VACANCY ANNOUNCEMENT!! In partnership with Bill Gates Foundation we are seeking to employ over 1000 youths in East Africa to help with the fight against poverty malnutrition illiteracy and violence. Applicants must hold a minimum of a College Diploma exhibit leadership qualities and possess excellent communication skills. Duties will include identifying areas that require immediate funding and coming up with long term sustainable solutions.
