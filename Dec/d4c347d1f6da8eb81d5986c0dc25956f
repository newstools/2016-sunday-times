The world is becoming a more dangerous place - of that there can be no doubt.Decisions by voters in the US and UK this past year showed that many chose to get onto the hamster's wheel of nationalism in reaction to violent religious fundamentalism fanning out from the Middle East.Every indication is that French and German voters will follow suit next year, which, with the strengthening of the neo-tsarist Putin regime in Russia and the aggressive noises by the Erdogan government in Turkey, stokes a toxic international stew of aggressive self-interest.A guide to surviving the festive season In such times one might be forgiven for becoming despondent, but actually it may help us focus on what to give thanks for at this time when those of the Christian faith reflect on the greatest gift of all.Let us therefore find joy and solace at this time of year, for the blessing of spending time with those we love as we take the foot off the accelerator of life.Our country has much to be thankful for. Its people have found their voice against abuse by the powerful, the threat of junk status has been averted by a national effort, and institutions protecting and enabling our democracy have stood firm.But most of all, it may be in order for us to toast our country and our people for something which, given the situation in the rest of the world, we do not celebrate nearly enough, namely the existence in South Africa of true religious tolerance.In our country, Christian and Muslim, Jew and Hindu, Buddhist and atheist live side by side as if it were the most natural thing in the world.Do we stop to think how blessed South Africa is that this state of affairs is accepted as normal, even as events in the rest of the world show that, sadly and unnecessarily, it is not?Especially in the integrated, urban areas, it is the done thing for Christians to wish their Muslim friends well and spare them physical exertion over Ramadan, or for those of other religions to enjoy watching Christian neighbours go completely over the top when celebrating Christmas with lights, presents and all the rest.As South Africans, we tend at times to become depressed that our democratic dream is not quite the miracle we had hoped for in 1994. Often, the warts seem to be just too many, and the dream seems deferred. But when we look at how religious violence is simply unheard of in this scrambled hodgepodge of a society in which we live, a bit of quiet self-congratulation, and perhaps some quiet thanksgiving, may well be in order.More to the point, South Africa's religious tolerance must be celebrated and defended as often as possible. We are exceptional in many ways, but maybe nowhere more than in the religious space we allow our fellow citizens. Let's endeavour to allow our neighbours to welcome the new year without being a wet blanket and complaining about the noise before midnight This Christmas has again been characterised by unfortunate racial incidents that continue to crop up even 22 years after our liberation. It is such a downer in this season of hope, love and giving.Would it be too much for us to extend, as a Christmas wish, an appeal to all South Africans to widen religious tolerance to include tolerance of all other demographic aspects, including race, language, age, sexual preference and cultural belief, and yes, even the rights of animals?The festive season is often a time of suffering and want for pets. The main culprits are those unthinking oafs who set off fireworks, and those who abuse their pets by leaving them at home without enough food to see them through.It is time to ask ourselves whether the spectacle of fireworks being set off can really be justified, considering the panic, incomprehension and suffering they engender among animals, including domestic pets.Surely not? This holiday, have the time of your life ... stay homeThus, we call on our readers to desist from setting off fireworks, be it to celebrate Christmas, New Year or even, in a few months' time, Diwali.Religion is a living and thus a changing thing; it evolves, and the South African mould of religious tolerance requires that we think not only of our own rights, but also how the exercising of such rights impacts on the rights of our neighbours.The same goes for the rather more worldly celebration of the new year next weekend. Not only animals must be taken into consideration, but also fellow humans.Let's endeavour to allow our neighbours to welcome the new year without being a wet blanket and complaining about the noise before midnight. And let's allow our quieter, possibly older neighbours some respite from our noisy celebrations after midnight. In that way, we all win.It will be the biggest Christmas present to the beloved country if we could let our fellow South Africans - and the many tourists visiting these lovely shores - be what they want to be, in the knowledge that their right to be happy could never lessen ours.It is in this spirit of live and let live that the Sunday Times wishes all its Christian readers a merry Christmas, its Jewish readers a happy Chanukah and all other readers happy holidays. May the peace that passeth all understanding permeate all your actions during this time of relaxation.
