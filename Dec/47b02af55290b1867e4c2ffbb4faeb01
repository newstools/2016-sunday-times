Gary Cahill's own goal gifted City the lead, but Costa equalised and teed up substitute Willian before Eden Hazard struck to send Antonio Conte's men four points clear of City at the summit.City's frustration boiled over in stoppage time with Aguero and Fernandinho red-carded, the former for a disgraceful lunge on David Luiz, the latter for pushing Cesc Fabregas over an advertising board.It was the second time in succession that Chelsea had come from behind to win, having done so against Tottenham Hotspur last weekend, as they recorded their eighth successive victory. Roodepoort man leading Cape Town CityPep Guardiola tasted defeat at the Etihad Stadium for the first time as City manager and has now seen his side go four home matches without a win.They were left to rue some profligate finishing, but it was referee Anthony Taylor who attracted the home fans' ire after rejecting four penalty appeals.A muscle injury sustained by Nemanja Matic forced Conte to change his starting XI for the first time in seven matches, with Fabregas coming into the team in central midfield.Guardiola showed his respect for Chelsea's recent run by mirroring the Londoners' shape with a back three of his own, as he made six changes from last weekend's 2-1 win at Burnley.Chelsea were given encouragement in the early stages, Hazard curling wide and failing to exploit a situation that saw him round City goalkeeper Claudio Bravo.But as the half wore on, so City began to pin their opponents back and so Taylor became an increasingly central figure.He had already denied City what would have been a harsh penalty for handball against Cahill when Cesar Azpilicueta's under-hit back-pass gifted Aguero a run on goal.Luiz leant into Aguero as the Argentine sought to run past him, sending him crashing to the deck, but Taylor waved play on to the fury of the home support.Shortly before half time, Ilkay Gundogan appeared to be caught by N'Golo Kante as he shaped to shoot from Aguero's lay-off, but again Taylor was unmoved.City had offered the greater threat, with Aguero threatening on three occasions, and the final minute of the half yielded the breakthrough.Allowed to advance to the edge of the Chelsea box, Jesus Navas dispatched a pacy cross that Cahill contrived to shin past Thibaut Courtois.
