This is not the first time the British triple champion has spoken out against F1's traditional set-up, with the sport still in a period of flux ahead of the 2017 season following its 6-billion purchase by the US-based Liberty Media group."The way Formula One is run is not good enough at the moment," Hamilton told Time magazine."The Super Bowl, the events Americans do, the show they put on is so much, so much better."So if you were to mix in a little bit of that template through there, I think we'd be more inviting to the fans."Hamilton previously scorned the F1 press pack at the Japanese Grand Prix in October, where he called the Q&amp;A conference format "boring" and advocated greater fan involvement.The thrust of Hamilton's ideas has already been experimented with at the 2016 US Grand Prix in Austin in October, as a 20% cut in Texas state funding made it a case of "innovate or bust" for race organisers.After the 2015 event saw attendance dented by torrential rain, this year's edition was drier and saw the F1 sessions bookended by pop music concerts from big-draw artists Taylor Swift and Usher.
