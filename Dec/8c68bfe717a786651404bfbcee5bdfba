A giant Christmas goat made of straw is erected every year in the Swedish town of G vle.Since 1966, the goat, an oversized version of the traditional Swedish yule goat, has been erected in the town square at Christmas time. Pretty much from the beginning, though, it's been a magnet for arsonists.The world's 20 most Instagrammed tourist attractionsThe very first G vle Goat was destroyed on New Year's Eve in 1966, and ever since, burning the goat has become a naughty tradition.Though the town has put efforts in place to protect it, this year it was burnt down less than 24 hours after it was erected.The straw-and-wood structure was put up last Sunday.Last year the poor goat survived until December 27 before arsonists set it alight, marking the 35th time in 50 years it has gone up in flames.Reports say the attackers struck when the guard took a toilet break.A black-swan sculpture in Beijing was removed only hours after its unveiling because of fears it could bring bad luck to the markets.On Monday, the enormous swan was placed inside the entrance of a fancy, financial district shopping mall - across the road from China's Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC).

They claim the fish were bought from a local market and were already dead when they were frozen in the ice.Some larger fish, such as whale sharks, were represented with photographs under the surface.Space World manager Toshimi Takeda told CNN that the attraction had been "very popular" in its first two weeks with an "unprecedented number of visitors".However, the public backlash started quickly on social media. One person commented, "This really makes me upset. Do you think children are happy to see this?" Another said, "You have no soul."Last week, Space World announced it would close the ice rink until further notice."We deeply apologise to all who had unpleasant feelings about the ice aquarium."Japanese media reports that the park will melt the ice, remove the fish and hold a memorial service for them before they are re-used as fertiliser.
