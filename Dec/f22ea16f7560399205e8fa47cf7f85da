The same applies to all Southern Hemisphere countries.Which explains why Air New Zealand has released a modified version of the classic Bing Crosby carol, Winter Wonderland, for those of us who don't experience a white Christmas.Called Summer Wonderland, it's performed by Irish singer Ronan Keating.The New Zealand Herald reports that the song is "an ode to pavs, jandals and everything else that makes the summer holidays special". That's pavlovas and slip-slops in SA speak.Though they have an Ozzy flavour, Summer Wonderland's lyrics are sure to resonate with South Africans too. They include: Sunburn sting, Ice blocks glistening. We ll hear the birds in the trees and feel the warm breeze, Strolling through a Summer Wonderland. Way down here, Christmas landmarks, Are summer flowers and funny tan marks.The airline's festive campaign also includes a humorous video - watch it below - which shows Keating and New Zealand child star Julian Dennison tweaking the lyrics to Winter Wonderland to make them more suitable for those celebrating in sunny climates.You can download the full song at Airnzchristmas.co.nz.video
