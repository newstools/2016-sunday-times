Sales of French bubbly were up between 20% and 30% this year, said leading retailer Carrie Adams."America sells the most champagne in the world, but it's Africa where the biggest growth in sales is happening," said Adams, of Norman Goodfellows in Illovo, Johannesburg.This week, on his first visit to the country, Mo t &amp; Chandon chief winemaker Beno t Gouez hosted a dinner at The Palazzo Montecasino in Fourways, Johannesburg. His brand is the top-selling champagne here. Adams said the champagne boom was fuelled by the emerging black middle-class, who were discovering "just how gorgeous bubbles are". Caroline Rillema, of Caroline's Fine Wine Cellar in Cape Town, said: "Young people demand instant gratification and champagne is considered the drink." Mo t &amp; Chandon prices start at R470 for non-vintage brut, and Norman Goodfellows' most popular bottle is the Nectar Rose, which costs R670.But among "the smart set" there was a huge thirst for the R5,000 Armand de Brignac Ros champagne, said Adams. "Apart from the big price tag, it's part of the bling packaging that makes it so appealing - and part of the vulgar consumerism from the US that South Africans have picked up on," she said.
