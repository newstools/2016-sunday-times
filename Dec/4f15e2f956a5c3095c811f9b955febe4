In a series of tweets on her official Twitter page the Harry Potter author confirmed the news when a fan asked the burning question, "When do we get a new novel?"Rowling responsed by saying, "I'm working on it (literally)" before revealing that she had indeed been working since 5:55 AM.However for fans who are looking for a book series of the current "Fantastic Beast and Where To Find Them" movie franchise, Rowling may have dashed some hopes when she went on to say, "No, no, no. There won't be Newt Scamander novels. Only movies. Calm down, there!"The author did confirm however that one of the books would be under her own name and the other under her pseudonym, Robert Galbraith."I'm not sure which will come out first," she added. "I'll let you know as soon as I do."
