We invited 30 Sunday Times Food readers to the HTA School of Culinary Art in Randburg, Joburg, to act as judges.They were presented with five supermarket house brands of warmed mince pies - with no branding - on separate plates.The mince pies were judged on appearance, taste, pastry, filling and whether the taster would be convinced to buy them or not.Auditor Stephanie Pardoe was on hand to monitor the process, from removing the packaging and numbering the samples to the preparation and judging. Pardoe collated the scores.First place: Pick n Pay Fruit Mince PiesJudges' comments: The pies had a crisp topping and a generous filling.
