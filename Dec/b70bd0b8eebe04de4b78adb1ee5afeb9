Jackson, a retired bank manager who turned 80 last year, has built an impressive collection of 1,258 books which started with his first book in 1947, a volume on then world heavyweight champion Joe Louis.Jackson says he remembers saving up his one shilling pocket money for 10 weeks, giving him enough to purchase the book at a Johannesburg store as well as the return train fare from Germiston, where his father worked on a mine, to Park Station.He estimates he has spent around R105,000 on the tomes that pack some 10 shelves in his office at the retirement village where he lives with his wife Margaret in the western suburbs of Johannesburg. Mayweather laughs off McGregor fightJackson's treasury includes Boxiana by Pierce Egan, which is believed to have been printed in 1818, as well as books signed by legends like Jack Dempsey and Gene Tunney.And then there are several gloves signed by many greats, South African and international. "I've met or seen 19 world heavyweight champions," says Jackson, a former TV commentator.He attended his first live fight in 1949, George Hunter, a 1948 Olympic gold medallist, defending his South African light-heavyweight crown against Freddie Vorster.Jackson's encyclopaedia includes a chronology of all South African title fights, the country's world champs and challengers, amateur stars, cornermen and promoters.His statistics illustrate the impact of the proliferation of world sanctioning bodies and ABC world titles.It took 63 years from Willie Smith becoming South Africa's first world champion in 1927, when he won British recognition as the bantamweight titleholder, until Dingaan Thobela was No 9 in 1990.In the next 23 years, a further 70 South Africans were crowned world champions, the majority of them lifting peripheral belts.Jackson's encyclopaedia, which runs to 583 pages, also includes a chapter on ring deaths in South Africa, listing 74 since 1889, of which 50 were in professional rings and 24 in amateur fights.Among them is the tragic case of Eppie Pohl, who fell into a coma after fighting Gary Ballard; he lay unconscious for 24 years before dying."He never woke," recalls Jackson, who was ringside at the tragic fight between Willie Toweel and Hubert Essakow, who died from injuries sustained in his bout."It was a big shock. Deaths were unheard of in South Africa at the time."Jackson, who did some amateur boxing and wrestling in his youth, was a useful soccer player in his day, playing for a professional team, Corinthians, earning three pounds a week. "I still have the contract."Pacquiao says Mayweather rematch still a possibilityIn 1961, he and a friend decided to play professional football in England, but once they got there they were lured by parties and adventures, so they bought an old van and drove 7,200 miles (more than 115,00km) around Europe.Jackson has no trouble rating the three greatest fights he has seen in SA. Two involved the same fighters, Mike Holt and Eddie Thomas, in the second and third bouts of a trilogy. The third was Arnold Taylor's 1973 title-winning classic against Romeo Anaya of Mexico. "That is possibly the best fight I've ever seen."In 2017, Jackson says he'd like to see British heavyweight Anthony Joshua, the IBF titleholder, take on a higher calibre opponent, like American Deontay Wilder or Joseph Parker. "Then we'll see how good he is."A rematch between Andre Ward and Sergey Kovalev would be interesting, as well as a middleweight showdown between Canelo Alvarez and Gennady Golovkin."That'll be a good fight."After 70 years as a fan and expert, Jackson's boxing heart beats strong.
