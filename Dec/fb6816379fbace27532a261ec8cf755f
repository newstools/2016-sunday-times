But for a professor to join in Motsoeneng's lunacy reveals how those we have entrusted with our public institutions have no regard for our laws.Professor Mbulaheni Maguvhe walked out of the parliamentary inquiry into the fitness of his board, claiming the ad hoc committee had failed to provide him with documents in braille, infringing his rights.It has since emerged that this Mampara was offered braille documents, but turned down the offer as a ploy to avoid accounting for his part in running down the SABC.His attempt to use his disability to avoid taking responsibility leaves a bitter taste.
