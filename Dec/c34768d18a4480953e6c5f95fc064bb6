It seems like a dumb idea at first - I mean, why waste time publishing an expensive hardcover book of pictures that first appeared - and enjoyed vast traction - on a digital medium?The book in this case is a collection of the most popular pictures published on the Instagram account of National Geographic, or NatGeo in this age of truncation and short attention spans.SA attraction makes National Geographic Traveler's 'must-visit' list for 2017This is the digital age - neither you nor anything else actually exists unless you/it are online in all your pixellated glory.Of course, I forget that there are some people (like me) who are Instagram "fails" and who enjoy the heft of a book in their hands, and who prefer their pictures in textured reality on a printed page rather than on the screen of some device that may or may not be giving you a bad back and premature double chin, depending on how much time you spend hunched over it.Enough carping, then. @NATGEO is a superb collection of pictures taken by some of the most famous names in nature and cultural photography - Frans Lanting, Beverly Joubert, Joel Sartore, Ami Vitale, George Steinmetz, the legendary National Geographic photographer Ira Block, and Steve McCurry whose 1985 picture of the Afghan girl refugee gave the word "haunting" a new definition.The work is, as one might expect from this pantheon of great shooters, magnificent. The book is small format - in keeping with Instagram's square theme - but this in no way detracts from the impact of the pictures.Part of the purpose of photography books like this is to give you ideas of places you should go and things you should see, especially if those things are under threat. @NATGEO also shows us why we should take better care of the planet we call home. @NATGEO - The most popular Instagram photos, published by National Geographic, about R330
