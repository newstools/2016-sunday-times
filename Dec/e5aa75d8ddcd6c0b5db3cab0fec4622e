The cast of Office Christmas Party have a pretty solid pedigree in being funny. So do the directors, Will Speck and Josh Gordon - at least if you concentrate on the priceless Blades of Glory (2007) more than their mediocre Jason Bateman/Jennifer Aniston turkey-baster romcom The Switch (2010).Here that same pair top the bill again, performing variations on what they're always doing lately. Perhaps staying durable as a comedy star is about elevating the not-very-funny-on-paper, rather than signalling panic or going down with the ship. 6 reasons why I just can't be the life and soul of the party any moreExhibit A is this just-add-zany corporate farce, which feels like an excuse for a collection of Saturday Night Live skits clumped into a wild party romp. Aniston, Bateman and several of their co-stars mercifully know how to spike the punch.Bateman is a newly single, weary tech executive just trying to get through the holidays, while Aniston strides about in dark suits as his ball-busting CEO, looking to fire everyone and cancel Christmas. Neither is given especially great material but their line readings often rescue whole scenes.The fateful party happens behind Aniston's back, thanks to her ne'er-do-well younger brother, the Chicago office's branch manager (TJ Miller) and his harebrained scheme to impress a potential investor (Courtney B Vance, who alternates between the film's dullest scenes and its most strenuously look-how-crazy-this-is).Miller, at least, is on form and gets a lot of likeable mileage out of his doofusy-party-guy routine.So is 22 Jump Street's Jillian Bell as a chummy pimp who takes him for a ride: she might spend half her screen time doing little more than waving a gun in his face but the lady sure can make a prop funny.Olivia Munn, meanwhile, is a nerd with a crush on Bateman and a thankless Eureka moment involving next-level wi-fi.Then there's Kate McKinnon. The Ghostbusters star does the film a heap of small mercies, starting with her character's self-stitched, multi-denominational seasonal sweater and proceeding through a great little bit about filing a sexual harassment claim against herself.She's the head of human resources, a stickler and perpetual killjoy who is charmingly uptight. Her manic moments are like a paddling of ducks squawking straight to camera: we need her.WATCH the trailer for Office Christmas party Office party With this lot all switching funny on as often as they can, it's just a worried wait for the overall power grid to fail, which it inevitably does - you can't take so many lazy establishing shortcuts and expect a functional third act to materialise.The actors' combined improv skills are the film's salvation and its undoing: the directors egg on their stars with spit-balling routines which pay off nicely in the moment, but make the expositiony stuff stand out a mile.Ideally you need that to be funny too, or at least mean something. It's particularly cringe-some to repeat said gags at the end, as if they'd figured out what was working late in the shoot and demanded victory laps for emphasis.In the annual way of these things, Office Christmas Party is something you might regret not dropping in on, but you could cut your losses after an hour or so, and only miss sordid carnage and a sore head. The Daily TelegraphRATING: 3/5 stars 'Office Christmas party' is on circuit.
