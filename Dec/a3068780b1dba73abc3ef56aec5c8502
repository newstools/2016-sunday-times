Samara private game reserve has grand ambitions. Their website says as much. "As the leading private conservation project in the Great Karoo, Samara forms part of a greater vision to create South Africa's third largest protected area in a global biodiversity project."Standing high above the vast, purple-blue-dappled expanse of the plains of the Camdeboo surrounded by the giant yet gentle hug of the mountains, you get a sense of the breadth of this vision. Weekend Escape: Port Wine Guest House, Calitzdorp The reserve's 27,000ha of reclaimed land are populated with leopard, huge herds of buck, mountain zebra, giraffe, rhino and lots of baboons and monkeys.To say that the Great Karoo is one of those primal and sublime places, where one feels uncannily like you're in the navel of the universe, is to underplay the strange sense of awe and peace its mysterious landscape can induce.It is arid but not in the way you expect. As I ran down the road early one morning (I was training for a marathon), I felt the peculiar magic of the Karoo work its charms on my addled urban spirit.The unexpected softness of the landscape acted like a balm to the urgency I feel day-to-day while the huge diversity of plant and animal life made my long, hot slog a constant visual delight.It helped that the rhino were safely ensconced elsewhere on the plain, according to Tendai Moyo, our charming guide, who assured me I could run without too much fear, but happily demonstrated how I should promptly lie flat if I did happen upon a black rhino with a yen to crush me.Nomsa, his wife, fed me a most magnificent breakfast after the 28km I managed.By the time I'd settled in next to the pool to take my well deserved rest and to watch the mating of the tortoises - which I am now in a position to report is loud, vigorous and highly competitive (I was surprised, too) - I was well under the spell of the Karoo.</img>Sibella, the famous rescued cheetah who lived at Samara (she died last year).

Image: Samara.comSamara has managed to create a highly luxurious, restful redoubt that still feels comfortable, familiar and like a weekend break in the home of a terribly charming, eccentric and incredibly hospitable aunt.She whips you off for moonlight dinners in the forest, or for lovely Sunday lunch around the pool but steps discreetly away into her private rooms when you tire of the fuss.I would return in a heartbeat.
