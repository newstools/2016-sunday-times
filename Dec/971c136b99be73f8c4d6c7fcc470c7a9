Bringing that dream alive with retro style is Grand Africa Cafe &amp; Beach in Granger Bay, which has been a favourite Cape Town summer destination since 2009. It's recently reopened looking even more beautiful after a multimillion-rand revamp courtesy of new stakeholders Harbour House.The minute you walk down the new boardwalk, the view of the ocean, palm trees and huge mirror ball will inspire a summer holiday mood demanding sparkly sandals and summer dresses for leisurely lunches segueing into sundowners.Harbour House opens a third restaurant at Constantia NekIt also feels like a welcoming and fun place to bring the kids for big family get-togethers. Even though it seats 1,000 people, with all the different areas (two separate sets of parasol-shaded tables on the beach, the terrace and two indoor spaces) it doesn t feel crowded and there s plenty of room between the dining areas for bucket and spade play, plus a giant chessboard and more.The Grand s approach to food is all about sharing. Going against the current trend for small tapas plates, it embraces enormous platters of seafood for the whole table and giant rectangular wood-fired pizzas to feed a family.Seafood is the cafe s speciality delicious tender calamari with aioli and salsa verde, oysters from the Knysna Oyster Company, linefish tagliata with grated ginger and Cajun spice topping, and fresh prawns served with peri-peri sauce. The huge Chalmar sirloin steaks on the bone are also proving popular, and there s also a short sushi menu.</img>Grand Africa Cafe & Beach's approach to food is all about sharing.
