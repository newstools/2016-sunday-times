The Buccaneers were held to a lively 2-2 draw by bottom club and newly promoted Highlands Park at Orlando Stadium yesterday evening. On Tuesday, they drew 1-1 with another newly promoted side, Baroka FC, in Polokwane.Augusto Palacios' side twice squandered the lead yesterday to settle for a point in the first-ever Premier Soccer League match between the two sides.Pirates could have finished this match as the new table-toppers had it not been for the consecutive stalemates.Instead, they dislodge Kaizer Chiefs in fifth place, who dropped a place to sixth after they were humiliated 3-1 by Chippa United in the earlier match, which was played at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium in Port Elizabeth.The Buccaneers now have 18 points from 11 matches, while the Lions of the North, Highlands, remained rooted at the bottom of the log standings with a paltry seven points from 11 matches. Chippa add misery to Chiefs, Komphela seasonTendai Ndoro, the Premiership's leading marksman, scored a brace in each half of the match to register his 11th goal of the season - four goals ahead of his nearest man for the Golden Boot Award.The Zimbabwe international put Pirates ahead as early as the second minute as he headed home a delightful Luvuyo Memela cross from the left.Highlands Park did manage to equalise on the stroke of half time when defender Justice Chabalala brought down Edwin Sitayitayi in the box and referee Lwandile Mfiki pointed to the penalty spot.Midfield player Thanduyise Khuboni stepped up and sent Bucs goalkeeper Brighton Mhlongo the wrong way to make it 1-1.But Ndoro was not done for the evening as he won a penalty 10 minutes into the second half. He converted the spot kick to bag his 11th goal of the season.The Lions of the North roared back in emphatic fashion as substitute Lindokuhle Mbatha's thunderbolt beat Mhlongo hands down with 10 minutes remaining.The early goal gave the Buccaneers an instant boost, as they took charge of ball possession with wingers Memela, Thabo Rakhale the chief tormentors while striker Thabiso Kutumela made some clever runs off the ball to distract the Highlands defence.Highlands threw just about everything they brought with them to Soweto, but are still in search of their first league victory under veteran coach Gordon Igesund, and just their second of the season.The first half was littered with goal-scoring opportunities for both sides and not so much in the second.Highlands, who were thumped 5-0 at Mamelodi Sundowns in their last league encounter last Sunday, have gone nine Premier Soccer League matches without a win.The draw was their fourth in 10 matches this season.Free State Stars, who were thumped 4-1 by Sundowns in the 3pm kickoff match yesterday, are second from bottom with eight points.Meanwhile, in another late match yesterday, at Cape Town Stadium, hosts Ajax Cape Town beat Golden Arrows 1-0, courtesy of a penalty kick by striker Nathan Paulse in the 84th minute.
