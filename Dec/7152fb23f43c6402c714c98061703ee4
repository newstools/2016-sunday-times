Some 36 staff members claim to have fallen ill between November 14 and December 15.The scandal at South Africa's premier holiday resort - which unveiled its R1-billion revamp at the beginning of this month - has sparked claims of mistreatment and threats of mass action by union members.While Sun City spokesman Michael Farr said he was unaware of any contaminated food, several staff members told the Sunday Times that they had been affected. Dumping of suspect sludge continues while waste firms take battles to court"Our managers know we got sick after eating that food and that we were hospitalised as a result," one worker said.Another said: "People fainted right here at work and one person was rushed to hospital in an ambulance."Two investigations confirmed there was a leaking sewage pipe in the storeroom underneath the resort's Sun Central building.In an inspection report dated November 8, Sun City's safety officer, George Dloke, said "dry food, raw meat, veggies, juice and other consumables" had been in the storeroom."A year ago the storeroom was used by maintenance [but was] moved due to a continuous flood of sewage," he wrote. "Yesterday ... an overhead sewage pipe burst."A subsequent investigation by the Bojanala platinum district municipality's health and environmental services department - sparked by a complaint from staff at the resort - found "a manhole in the premises which can be a health hazard in the event the sewage system malfunctions".Its report said: "There are other manholes at the entrance of the premises. The premises is also not effectively ventilated for food storage."Leaking pipes running over the stored foodstuffs can also contaminate foodstuffs if it's for grey water or sewage, as it's treated."It was explained that there was food stored in the premises but removed and destroyed after the complaint was lodged in the company. The foodstuffs were stored in the premises since November 2016 and removed on December 9 2016."Farr said: "After having been alerted [to] the leaking of grey water from water pipe joints, Sun City management took immediate measures to identify, isolate and destroy sealed packaged dry food which was leaked on, even though no penetration of the sealed food had occurred. The sealed bulk foods which had not been leaked on were also moved to an alternative storage location."He said Sun City was "not aware of staff members having fallen ill or having been hospitalised, neither have we had any requests to cover medical costs from any staff members".Farr said they had not identified any contaminated food.</img>A leaking sewage pipe in the storeroom underneath the resort's Sun Central building.

I also have video footage of it."South Africa Commercial, Catering and Allied Workers Union leaders at Sun City referred the newspaper to local Cosatu leader Madito wa ga Molebalwa, who said he had written to Sun International CEO Graeme Stephens and group human resources director Verna Robson last week after he was made aware of the incident.He said management's disregard for the union's inquiries had prompted members to consider mass action."We demand an immediate dismissal of [Sun City general manager] Raul de Lima, and also that Sun International arrange a medical inspection and treatment of all the affected members."We also demand compensation for the workers, as well as a public apology."
