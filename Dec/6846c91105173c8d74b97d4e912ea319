At 17-under-par and three strokes clear of Schwartzel, England's Chris Hanson and South Africa's Keith Horne going into the final round, Stone is seeking to end his year as he started it, with a win.The reigning BMW SA Open champion admitted at the start of this tournament that he has never felt more relaxed coming into an event, and it has showed.As Schwartzel shared the first round lead, Stone was stalking one shot back. And when Schwartzel took the clubhouse lead on day two, Stone edged ahead of him in dazzling fashion with an eagle on the challenging par-five 18th.But it was the way Stone unlocked the scoring secrets of a tough front nine here when he started yesterday's third round with four birdies in his first six holes that took him clear of the field. Caribbean, golfing world go gaga as Tiger surfaces"Any time you have a good start like that it makes it easier," said Stone, who was still playing with a few niggles from the back injury he sustained this week."I played great and holed some nice putts. I feel very confident with my game. One more day of it all coming together will be nice."Stone caught a lucky break on 18 when he hit his approach long but it hit the tree alongside the green and dropped down rather than into the water on an island green that has sunk many a championship hopes.But Schwartzel knows better than anybody how this tournament is won on Leopard Creek's back nine, and his five birdies in six holes from the turn yesterday to keep himself within touch of Stone will be a warning for the younger South African."I need to put myself in play more on the front nine. I'm putting beautifully but I need to give myself more opportunities," said Schwartzel."Brandon's playing good golf so I know I'm going to have to bring something special to the final round."Stone is waiting for it."I really admire Charl and the way he plays golf. In my opinion, he's in the top three of the best ball strikers I've ever seen in the game. There will definitely be something coming from him in the final round. He loves it here and I'm under no illusions that he is going to try and keep that trophy for himself."
