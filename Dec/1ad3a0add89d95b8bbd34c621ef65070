Gregory Gundelfinger and his cousin Mathew Stein, both 33, are the inventors of technology they say will eliminate the sim card and catapult the much-vaunted Internet of Things into the mainstream.Speaking to the Sunday Times this week from the Clifton beach bungalow of his father, celebrity divorce lawyer Billy, Gundelfinger said the "virtual" or "embedded" sim developed by the cousins' company, KnowRoaming, would be used in millions of devices."Sim cards are the most manufactured consumer electronic in the world. Billions are manufactured every year and there is no reason why you can't replace them with software," he said."It will be a reprogrammable sim card that's in your phone, but you don't have to deal with a piece of plastic every time you change networks."KnowRoaming started as a solution to expensive international cellphone roaming charges. Stein, a computer engineer, invented a sticker for sim cards that connects devices to local networks - and local prices.A new way to do business in the app age "There is a big problem with roaming charges and there is a huge discrepancy between local rates and roaming rates," said Gundelfinger."While you're in South Africa, the sticker is dormant - it doesn't interfere with your local service at all."It's only when you start to travel that it automatically switches you on to the KnowRoaming network."The company - based in Toronto, where the cousins live - then pioneered the virtual sim.And last month, with backing from South African billionaire Natie Kirsh, it bought US mobile network Telna."[Now we] are able to establish direct relationships with networks all over the world," said Gundelfinger."We're leveraging all of this network infrastructure to deliver out-of-the-box connectivity, to become one of the biggest global networks."Production of KnowRoaming-enabled devices will start next year."We are working with handset manufacturers so that when you take [your new phone] out of the box you immediately have access to network services without having to buy a physical sim card."Everything is prepaid and you can view the rates on the KnowRoaming app, depending on the country you are in," he saidIt will also be possible to have multiple numbers on the same phone - and calls and data will be cheaper."Networks play a lot of games with costs ... Our philosophy is complete billing transparency. Once you finish a data session you can go onto the app and see in real time what you have spent money on."
