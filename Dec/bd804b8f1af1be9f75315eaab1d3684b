Eight crew members of the Lion of Africa Vulcan, one of the 28 yachts taking part in the Cape2Rio race that starts on Sunday, New Year's Day, have been preparing for the transatlantic voyage under the supervision of the Cape Town sports scientist.Skipper Hylton Hale said the team had been on the low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet for seven months and would stick with it during the 14-day crossing, when they would live mainly on freeze-dried food.The South African team will need all the energy they can get to beat the competition from around the world, which includes crews from the US, UK and Angola.The 5,500km continent-to-continent race, billed as the longest in the southern hemisphere, "demands immense tactical skill when it comes to seamanship and weather savviness", said Hale."We will be burning anything from 5,000 to 6,000 calories per 24 hours," he said. Sun and sea and some serious partying Coastal cities look forward to a record New Year's weekend"A Tour de France rider burns about 8,000 calories a day and we are not far behind. We need to replenish that and the best way, we believe, is the high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet."We approached the Noakes Foundation in June. We did some blood tests - they wanted to determine our glucose levels - and from then we adapted ourselves to the high-fat diet."Some of the guys have lost a lot of weight, and they say they sleep a lot better."Noakes said the aim of the diet was to eliminate the "ups and downs" that typically occurred in those eating high-carbohydrate, high-sugar diets."The crew that can have the most people ... sailing the yacht during the race [and not resting or sleeping below deck] is likely to be at a big advantage. Thus a diet that can keep more of the crew up and active for more hours a day for two weeks might provide a definitive advantage."Simon Borchert, director of the Cape2Rio, said the race had attracted more entries than the last time it was staged, in 2014, and was an important fillip to the local economy."Sailing in the Western Cape, the leisure industry alone, contributes R1.5-billion a year to the GDP and within that we have phenomenal artisans and boat builders that are globally renowned," said Borchert."One of the success stories in transformation comes from a team called Gryphon. They are a group of guys that grew up in Grassy Park and Lavender Hill, really tough ganglands of Cape Town, who have gone on to become big names in boat building in Dubai and all over the world."They have come back and put together a crew that celebrates this transformation and are taking youngsters on board from the sailing academies to ensure that skills transfer occurs."The slower yachts in the race fleet left on Monday.
