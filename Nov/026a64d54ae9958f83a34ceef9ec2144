 The Boks have won just four of nine Tests in 2016 while England are on a 10-match winning streak going into the match. There is always pressure on us every time we play a Test but I don t view the outcome of the match as representing the entire season Strauss said. It s a Test and that makes it s important but it won t save or define our season. Uncapped Francois Venter set for Springbok Test debut against England"It s another opportunity to win a match. Both sides are missing key players for the clash with England going into the match without first choice locks Maro Itoje and George Kruis No 8 James Haskell centre Manu Tuilagi and wing Anthony Watson.The Boks are without openside flank Francois Louw wing Bryan Habana props Julian Redelinghuys and Frans Malherbe flyhalf Handre Pollard and No 8 Duane Vermeulen.Strauss though wasn t going to use it as an excuse and believed that the Boks 10-year 12-match unbeaten run against England gave them some hope of pulling off an unlikely win. We want to execute and play rugby the way we want to play while taking conditions into consideration the skipper said. We want to take a step forward and grow as a team and if we follow those processes results will come. We have prepared well. It s a new day and a new match but we have gained some confidence over the years by winning here. We expect England to be physical and tough they will maul a lot and their defence will be in our faces the whole game. They will also use contestable kicks and in the wet weather they have a good mix. We are going to be challenged but we are prepared for it. - TMG Digital
