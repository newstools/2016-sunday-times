1) It's made from white wineIt's an alcoholic drink made in the wine-growing regions around the town of Cognac in France. It is made by distilling white wine to create eau-de-vie, ageing in oak barrels for a minimum of two years, and then blending the eau-de-vie.2) It's not just an after dinner drink Cognac can be drunk anywhere and in a variety of ways - neat, with ice or diluted in a little water or mixed into a cocktail. Martell sells four cognacs in South Africa - a Caract re (R400 a bottle) is for the everyday cognac drinker and for mixing cocktails. The Noblige (R600 a bottle) is for someone seeking something richer and more complex. The Martell X.O. (about R2,300 a bottle) comes in a bottle designed by an architect. The Cordon Bleu (around R1,800 a bottle) is for the real connoisseur.How to drink cognac like a pro3) It pairs well with a variety of foodsI find it works well with different foods, even sushi and dim sum. I think it's the saltiness of the soy sauce that combines well with the cognac giving one a pleasant rounded mouth feel.4) You don't need to 'warm' cognac by wrapping your fingers around the glassMartell do not recommend warming the cognac as it brings out the alcohol too strongly and releases the aromas too quickly. 5) Cognac is best served in a tulip glassA tulip glass (like a wine-tasting glass) is preferable. It assures a much better appreciation of the entire aromatic range of the cognac.
