Makes: 1 x 300g jar or bottleIngredients:500g red jalape o chillies200g red Thai chillies100g red Scotch bonnet chillies6 garlic cloves, peeled45g light-brown sugar15ml (1 tbsp) sea salt125ml ( cup) rice wine vinegarSome chillies bite hard, and boy does it feel goodMethod:1) Put on your disposable gloves. Rinse the chillies thoroughly, and remove all the stalks. Remember, these things are hot and your eyes (and other body parts) don't like them.2) Put the chillies in a food processor with the garlic, brown sugar, salt and 125ml ( cup) of water. Blitz until smooth.3) Transfer the mixture to a clean jar and cover it with muslin (cheesecloth). Secure with butcher's string. Put the jar on a plate in case the mixture "burps" and overflows. Leave to ferment at room temperature for five days.4) Pour the fermented chilli mixture into the food processor and add the vinegar. Blitz until smooth.5) Put the mixture through a fine-mesh strainer into a pan, using the back of a spoon to push it through. You want to remove all the pulp and seeds so you end up with a super-smooth sauce. It will be a fairly thin sauce at this stage.6) Bring the sauce to the boil over a medium to high heat. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 30 minutes, until the sauce has reduced to your preferred thickness. If foam appears on top of the sauce, just use a spoon to carefully skim it off.7) Take off the heat and leave sriracha to cool to room temperature before bottling and refrigerating. It should keep for a few months. Recipe from 'Pickled' by Freddie Janssen (Hardie Grant Books)
