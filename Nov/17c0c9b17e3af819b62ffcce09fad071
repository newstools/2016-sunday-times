Following Republican candidate Donald Trump s unexpected victory in the US presidential election it fell to R13.8321 in early morning trade. At 3.36pm the rand was at R13.4950 to the dollar from Tuesday s R13.1828 still 2.3% weaker on the day. It was at R14.8865 to the euro from R14.5368 and R16.7078 to the pound from R16.3267. The euro was at $1.1032 from $1.1026. Old Mutual group s chief economist Rian le Roux said the rand tended to be more sensitive to any moves against the dollar than other currencies. That was likely to play out over the short term but higher precious metal prices should provide some counter pressure Le Roux said. Market reaction subsided in early trade after Hillary Clinton conceded the US election to Trump and Trump made a conciliatory victory speech saying he would like to heal divisions in the US.Trump said growth in the economy and infrastructure construction would be a major priority during his presidency. - TMG Digital/BusinessLIVE
