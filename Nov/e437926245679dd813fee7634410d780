Jeweller Ginza Tanaka is going all out this season with a 2m Christmas tree made with pure gold wire that's as fine as angel hair pasta.The shop in Tokyo's glitzy Ginza district says the 19kg tree is made up of more than 1,200m of gold wire."The wire is made of the finest gold which has a 99.999 percent purity level," Ginza Tanaka store manager Takahiro Ito told AFP.Ito said the tree was made by the jeweller's in-house artisans.The price tag? A cool 200 million yen (approximately R25,312,661).While it may be a stretch finding a buyer, Ito said he hoped the opulent display would show off Japan's world-famous craftmanship."We want them to see our great technique and craftsmanship, and the glittering beauty of gold," he said.
