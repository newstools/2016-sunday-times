Mogensen was one of the most important designers of the Danish modern era. He studied under Kaare Klint, a master cabinet-maker whose work was focused on quality construction and simple lines. He later also worked for him.Having trained as a craftsman, Mogensen distinguished himself from other designers of the time with his focus on traditional values of craftsmanship and his obsession with natural materials. While his peers were pursuing technological advances in furniture design, and working on wild and unprecedented designs, Mogensen made pieces that were simple, durable and comfortable. Taking its place in history: the Eames Shell Chair In 1958, during the height of the mid-century modern design era, Mogensen took a trip to Spain with his family where he was inspired by a traditional chair with broad armrests, common in areas influenced by ancient Islamic culture.He took this classic design, eliminated its intricate carvings, modernised the shape and materials, and added his signature functionalism to its basic elements. An example of this was the straps he placed on the chair, allowing the back to be tightened as the leather expanded, adding to its longevity.Mogensen presented the Spanish Chair at the Copenhagen Cabinet-makers Guild Exhibition. The broad armrests were a huge hit, as they created a space to rest a glass, cup or ashtray, negating the need for side tables or other furniture in the surrounding area, and allowing for a more open and informal space.With the chair's solid oak, vegetable tanned leathers and brass buckles, Mogensen proved that he didn't need to use steel or plastic to be innovative. In fact, the rustic combination of his materials developed a patina over time that improve the chair's aesthetic appeal.Danish Modern furniture is famous for its simple, uncomplicated design and functionality, making the Spanish Chair a perfect example of the movement.Mogensen designed for function more than form. While this chair may not be the first item you'll notice in a room, it has proved itself to be one of the most lasting pieces of the era.
