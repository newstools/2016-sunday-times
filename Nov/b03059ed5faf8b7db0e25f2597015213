In the run-up to the DA's motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma, members of the ANC were encouraged to vote with their consciences and "do the right thing". Many were subsequently criticised for toeing the party line.But 20 years ago, on October 31 1996, this tactic of voting along party lines rather than with MPs' consciences gave South African women a vital piece of legislation, the Choice on Termination of Pregnancy Act.Many ANC MPs did not want to cast their vote for access to safe, legal abortions on demand, because of their personal views. But the lobby to allow MPs to vote with their consciences failed, and in what might be seen as a precursor of some MPs being absent from the no-confidence vote last week, some MPs stayed home that day. Where laws protect access to abortion personal attitudes still a barrierThe legislation was viciously opposed by some political parties and religious and pro-life groups.Even Mother Teresa, who by 1996 had lived through two world wars, the Arab-Israeli conflict, the Gulf War and the Rwandan genocide, wrote to then president Nelson Mandela saying that "the greatest destroyer of world peace today is abortion".Not war, not crime, not drug trafficking or organised crime but abortion - the act of a woman taking a decision that pertains to her body.Twenty years after Mandela's parliament voted on that legislation, it still faces the massive hurdle of moral acceptance. Research on morality by the US-based Pew Research Center released in 2013 found that 61% of South Africans still view abortion as morally unacceptable.After his death, pro-life groups accused Mandela of the "mass genocide of his own innocent people" because of his stance on abortion.Turn up at the Marie Stopes clinic in Cape Town on any given day and you are likely to encounter groups of protesters outside. In February, to mark the anniversary of the enactment of the law, pro-lifers parked a hearse outside to "welcome" women using the clinic's services, which, other than abortions, include pap smears, HIV tests and pregnancy care.This stigma and the silence around abortions are probably two of the main contributors to about half of the abortions in South Africa being performed illegally - 20 years after legislation making abortion free and safe was passed.The reasons for the large number of illegal abortions are many: women don't realise abortions can be legal, which is not surprising given that a search for the word "abortion" on the national Department of Health's website turns up only one item, relating to family planning methods. They probably did not realise that, 20 years down the line, women would still be getting unsafe abortions Conversely, the advertisements for illegal abortions are plastered over street poles and dustbins and taxi ranks across the country. Evidence suggests many women think they are using safe, legal services when they respond to the adverts.Over the 20 years that women have been having abortions in public hospitals, there have been countless anecdotal tales of them being treated badly by doctors or nursing staff who have moral problems with performing the service - tales of women being beaten or berated for their choice, or not being given pain medication afterwards to teach them a lesson.In May, Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi said in response to a question from the African Christian Democratic Party (which used its pro-life stance as an election campaign platform in August) that more than 88,000 abortions had been performed in the previous year.The Western Cape provides more than any other province, with nearly 20,000 state abortions, followed by Gauteng (more than 15,000) and the Eastern Cape (nearly 13,000). Marie Stopes clinics provide an average of 40,000 abortions a year. Teen pregnancy prevention programme backfires Statistics on illegal abortions are not readily available and the department has stopped providing specific statistics for septic abortions and abortion-related deaths.The KwaZulu-Natal department of health, which is slightly more forthcoming with information, said in a press release in December last year that staff were undergoing "value clarification training" to teach them the difference between their personal values and "professional ethos", and the department was considering adding education about the legislation to the four-year nurses' qualification process.The press release indicates that in the previous year, 12,031 women presented to hospitals in the province with incomplete abortions and 1,455 with septic abortions. That is 13,486 complications from illegal abortions in a province that, according to Motsoaledi's statistics, provides about 12,000 legal abortions a year.No doubt this is not the picture those sitting in parliament on that day in 1996 foresaw.Up until that point, abortions had been legal only in very specific circumstances, in limited numbers and mostly to white women. MPs voting for the legislation hoped it would reduce the large numbers of women suffering as a result of illegal or back-street abortions.They probably did not realise that, 20 years down the line, women would still be getting unsafe abortions. And they would not have thought women would still need to explain their choices to protesters outside clinics, to bigots on the internet who accuse them of murder, and to the very people who are supposed to provide the service to them.
