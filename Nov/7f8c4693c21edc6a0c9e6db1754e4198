Digital marketing agency 25AM is predicting a bumper Black Friday based on the number of times local social media users have mentioned the topic in online conversations. Social media conversation around this event has almost tripled in comparison to the same period last year said the agency s Andre Steenekamp who added that the majority of this year s interaction continues to be driven on Twitter.In the days leading up to Black Friday in 2015 the topic garnered around 4700 mentions on social media. In 2016 it has already surpassed the 15000 mark. In terms of demographics the interest between male (47.5%) and female (52.2%) remains mostly on par with women just slightly edging out their male counterparts Steenekamp said.The Black Friday conversation is being dominated by users aged between 25 and 34 while those segment aged 55 to 64 are the least active. This could also indicate which age groups are likely to utilise online shopping facilities as opposed to travelling to shopping centres Steenekamp suggested. Interestingly the buzz around shopping centres remains fairly low in comparison to the general conversation around Black Friday this could also indicate a greater interest in online shopping as opposed to physically going to the shops. Despite this Steenekamp said big retailers appear to be pushing hard on social media with Game currently leading the way. Twitter and email marketing seem to be the most successful platforms for the big brands to create awareness for their Black Friday specials. Black Friday in the US is the day following Thanksgiving Day and it is seen as the commencement of the Christmas shopping season. TMG Digital
