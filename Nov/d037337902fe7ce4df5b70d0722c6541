As reports emerged that the rebels were seeking such a settlement, party provincial secretary Super Zuma told the Sunday Times there had been no approach from them - but the party's "doors are still open".He said: "We only heard in the media about that."We are confident we have a good case to defend and it is for them to substantiate whatever allegations. Until then we can't say anything."Now entering the province of KwaZuma-NatalAbout 200 ANC members took the party to court in July in an attempt to overturn the election outcome of a chaotic conference where Sihle Zikalala defeated former premier Senzo Mchunu.Mchunu's supporters argue that their delegates were systematically blocked from taking part in the election and that the vote was rigged.The ANC countered by saying the information in the hands of the rebels was fraudulent.This week the case was postponed to January next year.The case has caused serious divisions in the party ahead of its national elective conference in December next year.The Mchunu group has been associated with the faction that wants Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa to succeed President Jacob Zuma, while Zikalala's supporters are said to be campaigning for AU Commission chairwoman Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma.The party has delayed filing responding court papers and has twice asked for postponements. The ANC's legal team has requested information that includes party membership and the voters' roll.Last month the ANC's spokesman in KwaZulu-Natal, Mdumiseni Ntuli, said the ANC had discovered that some signatures purporting to be of "loyal and disciplined ANC members" were forged. He said they would open a case of fraud and forgery.In response, the rebels accused the ANC of delay tactics.The group's spokesman, Lindo Khoza, said it was surprising that the ANC kept asking for information it already had."This is a delay tactic. For example, when branch general meetings occur to nominate delegates, after the nomination and approval the names are put into an envelope and go to the ANC. No copy is left with the branch. What is there to verify when they are the ones with the records?"
