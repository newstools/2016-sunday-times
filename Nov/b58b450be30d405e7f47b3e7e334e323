Like so many good business ideas, the company was founded as a solution to a personal conundrum. Owner Caro Tapson found that she couldn t buy an interesting mix of seedlings in reasonable quantities."I was looking for something that is not available in the nurseries - a mixed variety of seedlings, some hard to find, that I could buy in reasonable quantities and that wouldn t cost the earth."Short on space? Plant veg in your flower bedsTo create the variety trays she needed, Tapson realised she would have to place pretty large orders of seedlings to her grower, a process which would need the buy-in of other gardeners. And so the Stokvel model of buying was formed."We are really clubbing in to make a mixed tray possible. It is my job to redistribute the seedlings from uniform trays into mixed variety trays and then get them delivered to everyone," explains Tapson. "So in short, you let me know you want to be a part of it, you pay upfront for your tray and you get it delivered to your home."What s more, Tapson and her husband Matt are the owners of a production company by day, so the next logical step has been to launch a Seedling Stokvel TV YouTube channel. The videos they upload contain simple tips and tricks for growing vegetables. "I would like to use this platform as the support base for people who buy trays, and for all South Africans interested in simple gardening," she says. Seedling Stokvel delivers to central Johannesburg, within the N3 and Western Bypass circle. The Summer Tray is due in late January 2017, so orders are currently open for that.
