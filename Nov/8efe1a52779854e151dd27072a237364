This idea was, understandably, met with the appropriate amount of cynical laughter as it was probably our 15th life plan for that specific day.So believe me when I say I was just as surprised as our nay-sayers when I received the notification, "You have been added to the WhatsApp group 'Morocco'." Accidental Tourist: Why it's so lekker to come home to South AfricaAfter months of thrice daily visits to cheapflights.com, joint bookings.com accounts and democratic discussions over WhatsApp, we were finally on our way.After 32 hours in transit, three planes and two trains, a new friendship with a helpful local and a speedy break-up with said local as we ran to join the morning commute (with an embarrassingly large 20kg bag in tow and R20 visplakkies flying all over the train tracks), we were one particularly Sex and the City-esque ride in a black Sprinter away from the most Instagrammable village you've ever laid eyes on.Chefchaouen is a water-colour artist's dream. Before you unpack your brushes, however, you'll have to navigate the maze that is the medina and climb 127 steps while carrying the aforementioned embarrassing bag, whose wheels are now redundant and you're left with delightfully violet thigh bruises.Once in your riad, you hand over your passports and enjoy some refreshing mint tea with sugar cubes (when last?) and the best hospitality the country has to offer.After enjoying the most amazing view and settling into our new crib (where they only offer sheets because it's clearly not duvet season), we went on to meet "the square men".Whilst attempting to do their jobs - shooing passers-by into their restaurants - they noticed an uncanny resemblance between one of our crew members and Shakira, whom, post Waka Waka, is assumed to be South African.This led to near altercations with the square men every one of the 15 times we walked through the square each day - a small price to pay in order to reach our corner pastry guy for midnight snacks. Shakira, whom, post Waka Waka, is assumed to be South African Three days later, as we headed back to Tangier, it felt as though we'd already been in the land of spicy tagines for at least a week, yet the trip was still just beginning. A 10-hour snooze on the night train, where we were handed just sheets, of course, delivered us in conditions that even Accuweather could not prepare us for.A heat wave in the vicinity of the Western Sahara makes it easy to understand why the dromedary would need to be able to drink 113 litres of water in 15 minutes.Although few of the merchants in the souks could speak any English, almost all could yell "fish and chips" to anyone who appeared to have even remote connections to the damp island up north.After numerous attempts to set this misconception straight, we encountered some actual Brits in a local apothecary's shop.Whereas the heat had definitely affected our team morale, our lifelong experience with the African sun had left our skin in good stead to deal with all 43 degrees that Marrakech was throwing at us. Unfortunately, the same could not be said for the real Brits, who appeared to be blushing a lot of the time. Accidental Tourist: Things I learnt behind barsIf ever you find yourself in the area, do spend a day or two in Essaouira. The Greece-like beach town on the northeastern Atlantic provided a welcome change of pace.Our home for the night was across the alleyway from a bakery and the morning aromas of baking bread were a welcome side dish to our sea-view terrace breakfast.We returned to Marrakech after "a holiday" from our holiday and spent our last day doing parkour on the walls around the Koutoubia and eating fig ice cream under the faux humidity of mist sprayers at Caf Kif Kif.Then we packed our bags, along with the eight tagines that had taken up residence on our hips (totally worth it), and headed home.
