The Twitterati went for Abrahams throat during an interview with EWN reporter Mandy Wiener on Wednesday morning.Among several issues Wiener pressed Abrahams on was his decision this week to withdraw the summonses against Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and South African Revenue Service (Sars) officials Oupa Magashule and Ivan Pillay.Abrahams said he had not been influenced or pressured to charge Gordhan hence he subsequently dropped the charges. I can assure the public that is not the case. I applied my mind to the matter Clive Simpkins however did not seem fazed by this response. "I can assure the public out there and myself that that s certainly not the case. Not a believable interviewee, sadly. Over-explanation. https://t.co/a4Yc4vR1ad Wiener asked Abrahams if he was politically captured: I m not politically captured. I m not captured by anyone he said. Pierre charged that if that if Abrahams was not politically captured then he was simply incompetent .I put those two alternatives two him - captured or incompetent - he didn't particularly like either. https://t.co/WoKVofWRs1 On his competence Abrahams said: As far as competency is concerned my career speaks for itself. There is nobody out there who can call me incompetent. I would not have the long list of successes had I been incompetent. Nobody who is competent can achieve what I have achieved in my career .Asked if he would charge President Jacob Zuma if he had a case to answer Abrahams said: I would charge a sitting president. If a sitting president has a case to answer then a sitting president must be prosecuted .Songezo Zibi wasn't buying it. This guy doesn't reason, he hallucinates. https://t.co/bUFjzF3SsS Eileen Nielsen accused Abrahams of being dishonest .Great interview @MandyWiener but #shaunabrahams comes across as dishonest,untrustworthy &amp; sanctimonious. #ShaunAbrahamsMustFall #NPA https://t.co/JJrS3e2zxe L. Keiller claimed to have felt sick after watching the interview. After listening to @MandyWiener interview I felt ill, perhaps he should be called #shadyshaun instead? Claims of competence are laughable https://t.co/wLrKYvHwxp- TMG Digital
