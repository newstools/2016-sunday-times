But free education has consequences for the quality of education offered and can deepen inequality.The three countries in Europe and South America all have different concepts of free education and different ways of implementing it.For anyone comparing these countries to South Africa, the strengths and weaknesses of their systems, within the context of their respective economies, needs to be looked at carefully.Niall Ferguson, a history professor at Harvard University in the US, said the argument for free education in South Africa was "wildly unrealistic", given the country's economic position. German example for Setas, collegesThe UK had a no-fee system until Tony Blair's Labour government reintroduced tuition charges for higher education in 1998. Blair acted after it became "clear that the UK universities were chronically underfunded compared to their American counterparts", said Ferguson.In Germany, "university education has traditionally been free", said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank."The result is that universities strive less for excellence than top US and UK universities do."But the overall standard is still pretty high."For Argentina, pulling off free education meant going to the World Bank, which in 1995 loaned the country $240-million for a programme that aimed to improve the quality of higher education.The University of Buenos Aires, which counts Pope Francis and Che Guevara among its alumni, is ranked 85th globally by QS World University Rankings - the only public university in Argentina in the organisation's top 100.Three Brazilian federal universities are in the top 400: University of S o Paulo (120th), the University of Campinas (191st) and the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (329th).A study by Dilvo Ristoff from the Federal University of Santa Catarina in Brazil that looked at the socioeconomic background of students found that the majority of those from public schools were enrolled in lower-demand courses, such as history. In the highest-demand courses, public school students were significantly underrepresented. 'African Harvard' a sad lesson for SA varsitiesPrivate schools account for 13% of Brazil's high school pupils, and provide 89% of medical school graduates.Ferguson said a university could not compete on an international level while offering free education."That's not a realistic business model," he said.Institutions needed to find a reasonable amount to charge for tuition and then have a bursary system through which poor students could gain access.That, said Ferguson, "is the model that is going to work best and create the greatest flexibility without leaving universities in a financial hole".Professor Marcus Balintulo, former vice-chancellor at Walter Sisulu University in Mthatha, said South Africa needed a fee structure that would "segment" university applicants according to their parents' earning capacity."In terms of fee-free education, what we suggested was having one model with three aspects," he said."One of those aspects would deal with the missing middle - that is those students whose parents fall just above the threshold in terms of earning capacity."For the missing-middle students, a possible solution could be to bring the Public Investment Corporation on board and have an arrangement that would allow public servants to use money from their pension fund to finance their children's education. This facility would be made available for those parents who did not qualify for a loan.Mines funded 18 000 students in five years Fees Must Fall protesters toldPoor students could be given loans from the National Student Financial Aid Scheme which, depending on how well the students did, could be entirely or partly converted to bursaries.The third component would require parents who could afford to pay fees to do so.It has also been argued that fees should be scrapped for all students who are accepted into university, which would throw open the doors of higher education to just about everyone who qualified academically.But Professor Steve Koch, head of economics at the University of Pretoria, said although this would benefit poor families, it might further entrench inequality if even rich parents did not have to pay university fees."What we need to ask is: 'Who will blanket free education benefit in a society as unequal as South Africa's?'"Matric results from top quintile schools are far better than the results from the bottom four quintiles," Koch said.Because of that, children from wealthier families had a higher probability of receiving a matric exemption. In that sense, "no-fee university education would disproportionately benefit those in the higher tax brackets", he said.tsamelad@sundaytimes.co.za
