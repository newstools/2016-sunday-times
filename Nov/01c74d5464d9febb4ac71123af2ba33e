True leaders have causes greater than their egos; Take the initiative and accept that you will need to be the catalyst, as there is no one waiting behind you to step up. Step into your space, feel the fear and act anyway; Exercise empathy and be open to others. If you do not feel other people's pain and joy, you cannot reach beyond your limited vision; and Accept your limitations as a leader and recognise that you are not perfect. You have to take yourself as you are, including all your fears and flaws. "It's your imperfections that define you, see them as assets. Laugh at yourself. Then you can be open to others," says Foster-Pedley.
