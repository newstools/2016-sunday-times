Steve Hansen's decision to make 12 changes to the side that suffered a first defeat to Ireland in 111 years last week aroused Italian hopes of a close encounter.But the hosts, now under the guidance of Irishman Conor O'Shea, were playing their first international since a summer tour of the Americas, and it showed.O'Shea said: "We came up against the best team in the world. I'm proud of the guys, they tried right to the end."Traditionally strong at the scrum, Italy collapsed at the first meeting of the packs inside four minutes to see Tongan-born Fekitoa touch down.Fyhalf Aaron Cruden hit the first of five first-half conversions, then Patrick Tuipulotu scored his second All Blacks try. Five minutes later, Isreal Dagg touched down and Cruden took the score to 28-3.With regular captain Kieran Read rested, Hansen had handed Sam Cane the captaincy for only the second time in a career that is expected to see the 24-year-old become the replacement for retired Richie McCaw.Five minutes after the restart, hooker Codie Taylor drew two Italians before passing to Dixon, who offloaded to Steven Luatua for his second All Blacks try.Hansen's decision to field young winger Rieko Ioane paid dividends. He replaced Dagg to make his test debut at the age of 19 and got his first points on the board with a late try.The Italians broke down and Crockett won possession to break through the defence and offloaded to Fekitoa for the winger's second try of the game, with Cruden converting for a 49-3 lead.Three minutes later Dixon touched down their eighth try after second-half replacement Matt Todd had thwarted a late challenge by Francesco Minto.The fans were given some joy on 67 minutes when Tommaso Boni's interception saw him run 50 metres to land the hosts' only try of the game.Tommaso Allan converted, but two further tries from Ioane and Waisake Nahalo wrapped up a comprehensive win. In the late match Wales beat Argentina 24-20 in a pulsating game.
