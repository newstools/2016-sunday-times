This follows a complaint Jan Steyn lodged with the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) against the mobile giant for the information displayed on its website pertaining to the device. Steyn submitted that the device is equipped with an Exynos CPU and not Snapdragon 805 as it claims on its website.The Exynos CPU according to Steyn has a poorer performance insofar as graphics are concerned. He added that the deal he signed with MTN included a 2GB monthly data bundle for the first 12 months. However he is being charged as soon as he exceeds 1GB.In its defence MTN said it had received the incorrect reference to the Galaxy Note 4 containing Snapdragon 805 from www.gsmarena.com a website which provides detailed and usually accurate information about mobile phones and their features.According to MTN it turns out the Snapdragon 805 chipset is only provided on devices supplied to the US and European markets whilst South Africa receives the Exynos chipset. MTN contested Steyn s argument that the Exyonos chipset is inferior to Snapdragon saying that each chipset has certain relative strengths and weaknesses .The mobile network conceded that Steyn was supposed to be allocated 2GB of free data for the first year but that one of its agents had erroneously placed him on the incorrect tier for promotional benefits. It [MTN] has since rectified the situation and will credit the complainant for the period between July and October 2016 by providing an additional four months worth of data as per the offer said ASA.The body ordered MTN to Withdraw the claim that its device contains a "2.7GHz Quad Core (Snapdragon 805) CPU. ASA also directed MTN to Immediately issue the instructions for withdrawal of this claim upon receipt of this ruling ensure that the withdrawal is completed within the deadlines stipulated in Clause 15.3 of the Procedural Guide and refrain from claiming that this device comes equipped with a "2.7GHz Quad Core (Snapdragon 805) CPU again in future unless this is actually the case .- TMG Digital
