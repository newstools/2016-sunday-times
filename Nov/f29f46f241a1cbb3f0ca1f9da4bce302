City manager Pep Guardiola has said he will not pick Tour until his agent Dimitri Seluk apologises for criticising the decision to leave him out of the Champions League squad."I wish to apologise - on behalf of myself and those who represent me," said the Ivory Coast player.The 33-year-old added that he wants "to help City succeed further".Seluk said Tour , whose 200,000-a-week contract expires next summer, had been "humiliated" when he was not included in City's Champions League squad. Guardiola, who was Barcelona boss when Tour was sold to City in 2010, responded at the time by saying: "Seluk must apologise. If he doesn't, he [Tour ] won't play. I cannot accept as a coach, when his player doesn't play, going to the media to speak and speak and speak."Asked by BBC Sport about Guardiola's stance, Seluk then said: "What do I need to apologise for?"On Friday, Toure said: "Those statements do not represent my views on the club or the people who work there."He has not played for City since August 24. "I have nothing but respect for Manchester City and only wish the best for the football club."I am immensely proud to have played a part in the club's history and want to help City succeed further."I would like to thank all of the fans for their messages through this difficult period. This means a great deal to me and my family."Tour , a four-time African Footballer of the Year, has scored 75 goals in 267 appearances for City since arriving from Barca for 24-million.The Ivory Coast international has won the Premier League twice, the FA Cup and two League Cups during his time in England.
