Christian Eriksen gave Spurs the lead against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge with a ferocious effort from outside the area which gave Thibaut Courtois no chance.It was the first goal Chelsea had conceded in the Premier League since 24 September.David Luiz was booked for a challenge from behind on Harry Kane, and he was followed into the book by Mousa Dembele of Spurs, who was booked for a cynical challenge on Victor Moses.Chelsea's first serious attempt on target came in the 30th minute when a Luiz shot was saved comfortably by Hugo Lloris.Tottenham's domination of play continued until the 44th minute when out of nowhere Pedro curled a brilliant equaliser into the net.Chelsea went ahead in the 51st minute when Diego Costa picked out an unmarked Victor Moses and his shot went in off Jan Vertonghen.Substitute Divock Origi and James Milner struck to send Liverpool temporarily top of the Premier League, as both they and Manchester City stole past previous leaders Chelsea yesterday.Liverpool were under pressure to produce the goods against a Sunderland team who had won their two previous matches.Former Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard was watching at Anfield, two days after announcing his retirement from football.But he could only look on with concern as the influential Coutinho was stretchered off with his right ankle in a brace after hurting himself in a challenge by Didier Ndong.Origi took the Brazil international's place and he gave Liverpool reward for their dominance in the 75th minute with his first league goal of the season.Jordan Henderson picked the Belgian forward out on the left and he cut inside onto his right foot and swept a shot inside the far post.Milner completed victory from the penalty spot in the first minute of injury time.Burnley took a shock 14th-minute lead against City at Turf Moor when Dean Marney met Nicolas Otamendi's headed clearance with a thumping 25-yard volley that nestled in the bottom-left corner.But Aguero equalised in the 37th minute, stabbing home after Burnley failed to clear a corner, and the hosts' luck continued to desert them as both Marney and Johann Berg Gudmundsson went off injured.A defensive mix-up allowed City to net the decisive goal in the hour, with Fernandinho's cross striking Aguero and going in after Ben Mee and Stephen Ward had got in each other's way."We are so satisfied for the points and the performance, especially two days after the Champions League," said City manager Pep Guardiola, whose side host Chelsea next weekend."All of the players showed huge character and a lot of personality - and after going 1-0 down at a stadium where only Chelsea are better at home."We are so happy. We have a long week to rest a little and prepare for Chelsea."Swansea upped the pressure on Palace manager Alan Pardew by condemning the south London club to a sixth straight defeat in a madcap game that gave Bob Bradley his first win since becoming manager.Palace led 1-0, fell 3-1 down, fought back to go 4-3 up, but eventually succumbed courtesy of a remarkable brace of injury-time goals from Spanish striker Fernando Llorente.The victory took Swansea off the foot of the table, where they were replaced by Sunderland, and left Palace above the bottom three on goal difference.Leicester reached the Champions League last 16 in the week and they were almost brought down to earth with a bump by Middlesbrough at the King Power Stadium.Alvaro Negredo twice put Boro ahead, but Riyad Mahrez cancelled out his first goal with a 34th-minute penalty and Islam Slimani rescued a draw with another spot-kick in the fourth minute of added time.Michael Dawson netted a 72nd-minute equaliser as Hull City drew 1-1 against West Bromwich Albion to deny Tony Pulis's team a third successive Premier League win.West Brom, the visitors, were bidding to go level on points with sixth-place Manchester United and took a deserved 34th-minute lead when centre-back Gareth McAuley headed in.But Hull gave a much better account of themselves after the break and levelled through Dawson, keeping them in the relegation zone but only on goal difference.West Brom remain ninth, a healthy six points clear of the relegation places.With both teams unchanged at the KCOM Stadium, West Brom made the more assured start and saw a huge 82% of possession in the first 15 minutes.While the first half was low on goalmouth action, the visitors threatened midway through when James Morrison shot wide from Salomon Rondon's lay-off.West Brom's opener duly followed.Matt Phillips sent a corner into the Hull box from the left and McAuley outjumped Curtis Davies to plant a downward header past goalkeeper David Marshall.Another header almost yielded a second goal for West Brom just before half time, but after climbing above his namesake Michael Dawson, Craig Dawson headed narrowly wide.Hull manager Mike Phelan made an attacking change at half time, introducing Adama Diomande - who returned from suspension - in place of Ryan Mason.The hosts looked far more purposeful in possession and having had barely anything to do in the first half, West Brom goalkeeper Ben Foster had to save from Robert Snodgrass and Jake Livermore. Snodgrass also took aim with a low free-kick that Foster had to claw away.The pressure told 18 minutes from time when Dieumerci Mbokani nodded down Snodgrass's free-kick and Michael Dawson was on hand to convert via the post.Fit-again West Brom winger Nacer Chadli had a shot saved by Marshall after coming on, before Rondon spurned a glorious chance to claim a late winner for the visitors by heading wide.
