Careful capital allocation is critical so that they don't end up overpaying for poor assets or pouring more capital into assets yielding low or no returns.During the last bull market, gold miners and other commodity producers did hefty deals, and when the market turned they found themselves in a corner. They have spent the last three years trying to cut debt.Now with the gold price up 21% to $1303/oz for the year to date some gold companies are itching to be among the world's top listed gold miners and are diving into investment opportunities. Others are being more cautious.So how should companies invest while seeking the best returns for investors? State flags its own slack mine rehab policingHanr Rossouw, head of resources at Investec, said the secret to gold- mining success was diversifying investments.Companies with exposure to one country faced a lot more risk compared to those with operations in several countries.Examples are Randgold Resources' operations in Mali, where it is in a tax dispute with the government; and AngloGold's Obuasi mine in Ghana which is in dispute with the government over protection from illegal miners.Both companies have operations elsewhere that can serve as buffers while these issues are resolved.Randgold Resources is already searching for new mining projects as earnings have risen by 55% in the third quarter."Our target is to have three projects defined in the next five years," CEO Mark Bristow said on Thursday."We've got some very exciting new projects. That gives us a new base on which to continue to grow the company."Projects in Senegal, Ivory Coast and the Democratic Republic of Congo could eventually become mines, he said.AngloGold said its capital allocation decisions were prudent and it would continue to invest in areas that give the best return."We are progressing our two key Colombian projects - La Colosa and Gramalote - to completed pre-feasibility stage by the end of next year, which will move them further up the value curve and potentially yield additional reserves for the company," said spokesman Chris Nthite. The company's project in Siguiri in Guinea was under way and would cost around $115-million (R1.55-billion) over the next two years, starting this year. This will extend the mine's life to 2023. "It's a high-return project in a jurisdiction we understand well," he said.Mergence resources analyst Thobela Bixa and Rossouw concurred that capital allocation was always a problem and a bull period - which is where gold equities were heading - was a rush of blood to the head for miners. But it should be a priority to return capital to shareholders, paying back debt and increasing dividends.When Gold Fields announced its third-quarter results and said it was pouring $1.4-billion into investments to extend the life of its Damang mine in Ghana, the share price fell 5.5%. Eskom board faults report but mum on cell callsBixa said the market did not truly believe that the operation could work out and the rate of return in the past few years had not been significant.Rossouw said that after cutting costs companies were realising that they had not invested in extending a mine's life, improving an operation or maintaining production, so they had to make a call whether to invest and where."In three years from now we can look back and say whether it was a great decision or a bad one. But for now, it's a pretty low-risk extension of the mine compared to building a new mine," he added.Although an increase in production was an important factor for gold companies at the moment, Bixa said cost-cutting and returns still were more needed than new gold investments.This week Sibanye took full ownership and completed the Rustenburg mines deal, putting the company's investments closer to its vision of becoming a top-five world producer in mining.AngloGold has said this year it will not be focusing on any mergers and acquisitions, and will rather concentrate on improving its existing operations. It has reduced its capital expenditure at Obuasi and its greenfields operations in Colombia.Harmony, which is investing in Papua New Guinea for copper and gold and is also extending the life of Hidden Valley, aims to increase production to 1.5million ounces in the next three years.
