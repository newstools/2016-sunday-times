Accompanied by lawyer Lorinda van Niekerk and maternal uncle Andr du Toit, Van Breda spent about half an hour in the house at De Zalze Winelands Golf Estate in Stellenbosch.The four-bedroom home recently sold for R6.2-million but it remains in the name of the Van Breda family trust until the transfer is completed.Van Breda arrived early on Wednesday as a passenger in what a neighbour said was his late father's Mercedes-Benz SUV.Sporting a man bun, the axe-murder accused appeared focused as he spoke to Van Niekerk outside the front door.Van Breda s defence team wants to scrutinise forensic evidence against the alleged axe murderVan Niekerk would not reveal the purpose of the visit but said Van Breda was not escorted to the scene of the crime by police. "I can't share any information with you. I cannot share information with any of the newspapers about anything to do with Henri's visit to De Zalze."A source at De Zalze confirmed that Van Niekerk had sought permission for Van Breda to visit.Last week, Van Breda's lawyers asked the prosecution to hand over its forensic evidence so their own experts can examine it before the case resumes on February 3.The 21-year-old is accused of murdering his father, Martin, mother, Teresa, and brother, Rudi, in January last year, as well as the attempted murder of younger sister Marli.Marli's advocate, Louise Buikman, was granted extended curatorship of the teen after she turned 18 last month."The court endorsed that I should remain in my capacity as curator ad litem to assist Marli in legal proceedings and that I will also confirm all major decisions relating to Marli, which include her therapy and schooling, in consultation with Marli's family, her teachers and therapists," said Buikman.Marli sustained serious injuries in the attack, including a severed jugular. Buikman said she had retrograde amnesia and could not remember what happened.In September, Van Breda and his girlfriend, Danielle Janse van Rensburg, were arrested for possession of dagga and they still face drug charges in the Cape Town Magistrate's Court.At the time, Van Niekerk told the Sunday Times: "His girlfriend has admitted in court that the dagga belonged to her. Henri maintains that he is not guilty."Van Breda was released on R1,000 bail while his girlfriend was released on bail of R200.
