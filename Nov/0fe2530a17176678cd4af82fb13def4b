Phahlane is embroiled in an ugly conflict with the Independent Police Investigative Directorate after the police watchdog body accused the acting commissioner of interfering with witnesses in a case it is investigating.At the centre of the investigation is Phahlane's R8-million house at the exclusive Sable Hills Waterfront Estate, north of Pretoria.Questions have been raised about how he can afford such a property on his R1.6-million-a-year salary.But yesterday Phahlane hit back at Ipid and his critics, saying he was not "a lowly paid" policeman and possessed the "financial muscle" to build the mansion.Phahlane investigator receives death threatsIpid announced this week that it wanted a warning statement from the acting police commissioner amid claims surrounding his house."I am in good financial standing ... I didn't build a house for R8-million."It is just way out of my league," he said in an interview with the Sunday Times yesterday."I bought a piece of land and got a bond for it for about R590,000. I sold my house in Montana and rented ..."I went to the bank for a second bond for R3-million, which the bank approved but not for 100%."I also had financial muscle from the sale of the house to kick-start the project," he said.He claimed that the allegations against him were part of smear campaign."I can't help it if between when I completed the house and now, the house is valued [at R8-million] but I have never made it my business to go to an evaluation and say how much is this house."I am just happy to have a home," said Phahlane.Ipid is investigating how Phahlane was able to afford the house after private investigator Paul O'Sullivan laid a complaint with the police watchdog body.The warning statement relates to allegations that potential witnesses in the case had been threatened.A fuming Phahlane said the allegations were baseless."I have been a public servant for the past 31 years and have been a general for more than 10 years. We are not millionaires at that level but [we earn] more than just a living wage." Once he's been arrested and charged, I will also be more than happy to give a press conference, not only on him, but also on his accomplices He said he lived frugally and was married to a senior manager "in the organisation". His annual package was R1.6-million."We know how to manage our finances. Someone is out there making noise as if we are constables who were appointed yesterday. After 31 years why can't I afford that house?"He also denied that he owned the BMW i8, which costs around R2-million, he had been seen driving.BMW had given him the car to test drive, he said."I have test-driven an X5, M4 and many other cars," he said.story_article_right2Ipid should rather probe the "unethical conduct" of its investigators and the involvement of O'Sullivan, he said.He had evidence of Ipid investigators visiting his estate manager to view his house plans."O Sullivan is not an official of Ipid, if he is a complainant, if the builder is a witness and he is being interviewed by Paul O'Sullivan with the Ipid people, who is Paul O'Sullivan?"Is he an investigating officer, is he a complainant or a witness? He can't be all three. He said he lodged a complaint to Ipid why is he out there leading the investigation?"O'Sullivan said he had gathered evidence against Phahlane but declined to provide details."You should be speaking to Ipid, not me, as I have agreed with them to maintain silence on the issues concerning Phahlane ... Once he's been arrested and charged, I will also be more than happy to give a press conference, not only on him, but also on his accomplices," he said.Ipid spokesman Moses Dlamini said the police watchdog was not commenting on its ongoing investigation but was concerned about threats made against its investigators.
