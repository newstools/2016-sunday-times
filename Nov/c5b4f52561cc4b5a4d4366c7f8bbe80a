It was third time lucky for the ANC after managing to get the majority of its caucus to attend the sitting. Two previous votes failed due absent ANC MPs.A total of 228 MPs voted for the passing of the bill while 86 voted against it. There were no abstentions.The party issued a stern warning last week after several MPs failed to pitch for the crucial vote.Chief whip Jackson Mthembu said the failure to transfer the Bill disappointing and embarrassing .Mthembu said that 40 of the party's 249 MPs had been granted a leave of absence for last week Wednesday s vote.The remaining 209 had all confirmed their attendance in the house he said.Finance minister Pravin Gordhan had tabled the Division of Revenue Amendment Bill three weeks ago during the medium-term budget policy statement which provided for a R5.41 billion adjustment to national budgets in South Africa.ANC caucus spokesperson Moloto Mothapo said their expectation was for all MPs to do their jobs across all political parties . You ll know that there was a challenge where quite a number of MPs were away on international visits and oversight. All those were back said Mothapo.He said the party welcomed the passing of the bill because it is important for the funding of service delivery particularly for the poor .DA finance spokesperson David Maynier said following a third three-line-whip the ANC finally managed to form a quorum and pass the DoRA. The failure to pass the Division of Revenue Amendment Bill despite two votes two three-line-whips and a barrage of text messages begging members to vote is unprecedented in Parliament said Maynier.- TMG Digital/Parliamentary Bureau
