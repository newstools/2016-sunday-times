Some fidget with the clothing rails. Others affect a business-as-usual nonchalance.But you hardly need to look closely to realise that the clearance sales in the store are indicators of Edcon's failures and not a reflection of normality."This was a spring clean for us. We are clearing a lot of the international brands that have been unsuccessful."Brookes, who has been on the job for just over a year, has dealt with the worst and weathered the blows as South Africa's largest non-food retailer has bled market share against the backdrop of declining credit sales. Massmart wins ConCourt bun fight over leases that limit tradeHowever, signs of a changing retailer are slowly starting to emerge.This week, Brookes told Business Times the retail group had renegotiated a deal with Absa to provide 70% more opening credit to customers.Instead of entry credit of R1,600 at Jet, "we'd be giving them R2,400 and at Edgars instead of getting R2,400, they'd be getting close to R3,000, which will make a good difference to our credit sales. Over a period of time this will help our credit availability," he said.Edcon's credit book stands at about R200-million - at least R500-million less than what Brookes expects it to be at this time of the year."So we will take the credit of the slightly more risky customer that the Absa bank doesn't want."In 2012, Absa bought Edcon's credit book for R10-billion to enable the bank to provide retail credit to Edcon customers.These are not the only changes that the ailing department store is making.The Kelso brand has been moved to the front of the group's Edgars stores, as it embarks on an extensive clearance of stock from the 12 international brands it has culled from a list of 37. Brookes expects the stock will be cleared by March.As result of the brand shake-up, Edgars - which accounts for about 50% of Edcon's business - has been running low on stocks of the Kelso range."People want it next season, so we are stepping up 30% to 40% in orders of Kelso, so that will give us the season where we start to get some sales."The success of the brand has prompted the group to open its first Kelso stand-alone store in Cape Town, with others in the pipeline, depending on the success of the flagship. I've got a call with them [investors] tonight at six... I've been in the game for over 40 years and this has probably been the hardest that I've had to work "It's doing better than any of our international brand stores. We've said if we get the product right and it's something that the customers want, it's a good fit. It's a good season and it's a well-known brand and we are starting to see that already," Brookes said.Edcon was recently bought by a consortium in a R20.7-billion debt-for-equity swap, the result of which is that California-based fund manager Franklin Templeton is Edcon's largest shareholder. Standard Bank, Barclays Africa, FirstRand and Investec are also new shareholders.Edcon, which operates 1377 stores nationwide and has a combined workforce of 43630 employees in South Africa, including full-time and casual staff, also plans to employ and train 2000 new staff as part of the group's focus on improving customer services delivery across the group.Although the new jobs will come at a cost for the retailer, these will be absorbed by and measured against the increase in gross profit."It's got to have a formula for our investors. We are making between double and triple the amount of money we are investing in staff, so they become self-generating," Brookes said.SBG Securities retail analyst Kaeleen Brown said the worry for Edcon's competitors would be pricing. Retailers hoping Christmas came early on Black Friday"They've got a lot of old stock and they discount that stock aggressively. That disrupts pricing in the market - and that's bad for everybody else."Edcon is the biggest fish in the sea, so you want to figure out or try and figure out what they are doing in order to figure out how much is left for everybody else," Brown said.Brookes said some of the stand-alone international brand stores Edcon may be "giving up could go to a Cotton On, but they are not big enough to go to an H&amp;M".Edcon has about 60 investors, who have committed to R600- million in capex next year and potentially more if needed.Edcon has been interviewing candidates for a new board with global recruitment firm Spencer Stuart and although Brookes would not reveal any names, he said "six of the seven will be local and at least three of them, if you exclude myself and the CFO, will be from a retail background, which we have not had before".As he walks through the section of the Edgars branch in Sandton City devoted to the Forever New brand, Brookes looks at his watch apprehensively."I've got a call with them [investors] tonight at six. I speak to them two to three times a week. I've been in the game for over 40 years and this has probably been the hardest that I've had to work."tshandup@sundaytimes.co.za
