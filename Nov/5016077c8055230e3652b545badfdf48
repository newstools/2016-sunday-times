On Tuesday, while glued to TV screens for the court hearing on whether the public protector's State of Capture report should be released, we marvelled at the quality of Advocate Tembeka Ngcukaitobi's argument. We celebrated the emergence of the 38-year-old as one of the country's sharpest legal minds.President Jacob Zuma and ministers Mosebenzi Zwane and Des van Rooyen had approached the court to oppose the release of Thuli Madonsela's report on the alleged improper and unethical conduct by the president and the powerful Gupta family. 'Unfit NPA boss has harmed the rule of law'Ngcukaitobi, appearing for the EFF, not only stole the show, but overshadowed his more illustrious colleagues, becoming an instant celebrity. Together with advocates Dumisa Ntsebeza and Dali Mpofu, veterans of jurisprudence, he argued before a full bench for opposition parties to be allowed to intervene in Zuma's urgent application.Judges Dunstan Mlambo, Phineas Mojapelo and Dawie Fourie granted the application before Zuma withdrew his application.This led to the court ordering the release of Madonsela's findings. Mass celebrations broke out around the country - a clear indication that the ruling had boosted the credibility of the judicial system.If you consider that Madonsela is an advocate, the week belonged to our legal eagles.Which is why it was so painful to watch one of them shred his professional reputation as he was forced to withdraw the spurious charges he had brought against Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan.
