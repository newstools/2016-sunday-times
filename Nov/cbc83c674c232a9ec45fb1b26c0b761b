The conduct of Mark Williams, of East London, was described as "deplorable" by Judge Clive Plasket in the High Court in Grahamstown this week.Williams was sued by Johannes Erasmus, who was awarded R3,509,650 by the Road Accident Fund. Williams kept R802,620 for fees, but the judge ordered him to hand over R250,000 immediately and to submit detailed accountsPlasket said Williams had acted for Erasmus on a contingency basis. He claimed to have given Erasmus a "discount" but had kept at least R472,000 to which he was not entitled.Dodgy lawyers stealing millions from their clientsThe Contingency Fees Act was not a "licence to plunder", the judge said."The conduct of Williams in appropriating his client's money is deplorable. So, too, is his gross [overcharging].These factors, the spurious defences that he has raised and the way in which he has conducted this litigation are red flags as to his suitability to practise."Plasket awarded costs against Williams and said he would report him to the Cape Law Society.In September, the Sunday Times revealed that 49 lawyers had been struck off the roll in the year ended July - 24 of them for plundering trust accounts; 11,230 complaints had been registered against attorneys.Last week, Johannesburg attorney Paul Ranamane was struck off the roll over the disappearance of R5-million paid into his trust account in 2010 by the Gauteng department of public works, roads and transport.
