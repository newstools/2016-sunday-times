Cape Town police nabbed Brian Wainstein for alleged possession of uncut diamonds this week as he cruised around town in a luxury car. Missing number plates on Wainstein's black BMW 750 attracted the attention of the police on Wednesday afternoon - and he acted even more suspiciously when he was stopped."During a preliminary investigation the driver of the vehicle got out and took something out of his pocket and attempted to hand it over to his friend," said Western Cape police spokesman Captain FC van Wyk."Vigilant police officers noticed the attempted exchange and confiscated the plastic packet. They opened the package and found 12 uncut diamonds wrapped inside."Councillor JP Smith, responsible for safety and security, confirmed to the Sunday Times that the suspect is Wainstein. Van Wyk said the man, who has dual South African and Israeli citizenship, could not account for the diamonds.Three years ago Wainstein, dubbed the "Steroid King", fought extradition to the US, where he was wanted in connection with dealing in steroids worth R76-million.He was released from custody on Thursday and it is unclear when he will be back in court for the alleged possession of the gems.Van Wyk said the matter was under investigation.An Irish news website reported in 2007 that Wainstein was handed a two-year prison sentence, which was reduced to four months after he pleaded guilty to charges of unlawful possession, sale, and distribution of drugs.
