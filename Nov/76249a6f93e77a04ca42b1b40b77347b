This is according to a research conducted by the Institute for Race Relations and compiled in a report entitled Life in South Africa: Reasons for Hope. The real GDP per capita increased from R42.386 in 1994 to R56.343 in 2015 researcher John Bostock said at a media briefing on Tuesday. This is not looking at inflation but at the real increase. The research also shows an increase of disposable income from R23 686 in 1994 to R33 660 in 2015. That is very encouraging because people are better off than they were in 1994 Bostock said.According to the research the number of people living in formal housing increased 131.3% between 1996 and 2016. The number of South Africans living in informal housing has increased by 51%. This means that formal housing is increasing at a faster rate. TMG Digital
