Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary revealed this week his ambition to offer zero fares - with the airline making money instead from sharing revenues with airports to which it has attracted passengers.Speaking at the Airport Operators Association conference in London, he said the increasingly attractive deals being offered to his airline by European airports, as well as the possible reduction or abolition of some taxes would eventually allow his airline to give away flights. Airline's policy of weighing passengers sparks big, fat furyHe said: "I have this vision that in the next five to 10 years airfares on Ryanair will be free, in which case the flights will be full.""We will be making our money out of sharing the airport revenues; of all the people who will be running through airports, and getting a share of the shopping and retail revenues at airports."The Irish airline expects to carry 119 million passengers this year and is growing its fleet, with capacity expected to pass 200 million by 2024.Of the free flights, he added: "It won't happen at Heathrow or big-hub airports. But [with] most of the other airports looking for big traffic growth, that process [of lowering fees] is already starting."About a quarter of Ryanair's income is currently from add-ons, such as car hire and in-flight sales.
