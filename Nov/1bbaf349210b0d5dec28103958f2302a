The eight-man group are title winners on TV dance shows, have featured in local and international music videos and were flown to Germany to promote clothing company Floris van Bommel.The eight, all from Tembisa on Gauteng's East Rand, are Thapelo Mabena, Abel Vilakazi, Bonginkosi Mbatha, Wandile Mzima, Linda Mahlangu, Bongani Shabangu, Bonginkosi Masango and Sandile Magagula. Youngsters told to dream big and keep practising"It all started with pantsula and indlamu [traditional/cultural dance] but today we see ourselves as more than that ... we are artists," says Mzima. Their artistry was evident when they created what they dub kasi-tap."We took normal shoes and put the bottom of a can under the shoes, which created a great tap sound."Despite the stigma of gangsterism attached to it, the dance maintains its place in South Africa's history. Pantsulas were common in Joburg from the 1950s to the '90s .It seemed the dance was going to die out post-apartheid, but kwaito brought it back to the fore of township youth culture. These days, however, it battles a shift to hip-hop and pop culture."I could say we made history [within the pantsula circles] here in South Africa, my man, especially in national dance competitions," says Magagula, who is one of the founding members. "We're the first pantsula group to make it to the finals of SA's Got Talent, in 2010, where we didn't get enough votes. We won everything at small dance competitions like Jika Majika."They also won the second season on dance show Step Up or Step Out in 2012 - against some of the best hip-hop dancers in the country.One of their dreams is to one day have a dance company in Tembisa, which will teach and manage up-and-coming dancers and keep pantsula alive.WATCH: How Tembisa Revolution promoted Floris van Bommel abroadTembisa revolutionTembisa Revolution have about 50 years' dancing experience between them, but there's more than just "dance-member" vibes here, there's brotherhood.This was put to the test in September last year when one of the founding members of the group, Moses Moeng, died unexpectedly."It shook us all! We were dancing the previous night on Idols together as normal and we wake the following morning to hear that he's dead," says Mzima.As the anniversary of Moeng's death came around, the men gathered in their rehearsal space in Tembisa's Moses Molelekwa Art Centre."We would have liked to celebrate his life in a big way , but we just came here, locked ourselves in one of the rooms and danced for hours," says Vilakazi.
