Available in flavours like vanilla-cinnamon, toasted coconut, creamy cacao and peanut butter, these frozen treats have been developed by health guru and health blogger Cara-Lisa Sham together with Paul's Homemade Ice Cream. The desserts are great for those looking for a healthier alternative to regular ice cream - although a 125ml carton of toasted coconut contains 963kJ. All flavours are made with coconut milk and coconut cream and sweetened with xylitol. The toasted coconut was a favourite - lovely and creamy with delicious toasty bits of desiccated coconut.Available from Paul's Homemade Ice Cream stores in Rosebank (Johannesburg) and Sandton.
