While question marks have been raised over how the Cape Town-based firm would be able to acquire Spur, which is double its valuation, the companies did not dismiss talk of future corporate activity outright.Responding to questions over Grand Parade's potential interest in acquiring the R3.4-billion company, Spur Steak Ranches group CEO Pierre van Tonder said it was too early to comment.He added: "I pose this question - is it not for Spur to take over GPI?"Talk of a possible acquisition "creates speculation in the marketplace which isn't even on the table yet", Van Tonder said."Our perspective is: let the ink dry on the first transaction, then we'll take other transactions bite by bite and see where there are synergies and how both companies can benefit and how we can enhance shareholder value."This week, Grand Parade raised its stake in Spur from 10% to 28.8%. According to company law, if an investor crosses the 34.9% shareholding mark in a company, a mandatory offer has to be made for the remaining shares. Africa's grocer gets to sleep in after 37 yearsGrand Parade bought the shares from Coronation Fund Managers for R40 each, a 20% premium to Spur's closing price on Monday.Spur's shares have gained just a third of a percentage point since the announcement of the transaction on Monday and ended on Friday at R32.Grand Parade closed the week 4.83% lower.CEO Alan Keet said the company, which also owns the master franchise for Dunkin' Donuts and Baskin-Robbins, assessed every investment on its merit."Whether that means we own Spur or just have a significant stake in it, so that we can get full value for our existing assets - that is what we are busy discussing and that is the value we are hoping to unfold in the next while," Keet said."We don't live in a vacuum and we are subject to shareholders' needs and wants. We just believe that Spur and our food business [getting] together, there is a lot of value that's currently on the table," said Keet.Spur owns brands such as John Dory's, RocoMamas, Panarottis and Captain DoRegos, but industry insiders have raised questions about Grand Parade paying such a high premium for a non-controlling stake in the company.Robyn Turner, an equity analyst at Avior Capital Markets, said that from a Grand Parade point of view the transaction had longer-term strategic intent."In order to say that you are going to make a return on that premium, you have to know what they are going to generate with the business and at the moment you can't quantify that, because we are not entirely sure what Grand Parade plans on contributing to Spur," said Turner.The country's biggest fast-food and casual-dining owner, Famous Brands, has been on an aggressive acquisition path in recent years.The owner of Steers has made six acquisitions in the past year alone, with purchases of brands such as Salsa Mexican Grill and UK-based Gourmet Burger Kitchen, and investment in back-end operations Tomato Paste Plant and Lamberts Bay Foods. Wiese the key to any Shoprite-Steinhoff mergerFamous Brands has a market capitalisation bordering on R15-billion.The company had "got the model right and there is no harm in trying to replicate their model and we are looking at premium brands", Keet said."We've currently got three premium brands, we believe that Spur has got a basket of brands and there's no harm in replicating Famous Brands with that model with those brands."But it's not to say we will compete with them, there is enough room for us to play," Keet added.Sasha Naryshkine, a portfolio manager at Vestact, said it wouldn't make sense for Grand Parade to buy Spur, because of their respective market cap s."Where are they going to get the money from?"After Grand Parade 's 28%-plus shareholding, the next biggest investors in Spur are Allan Gray with 13%, Investec with 10% and the Management Trust with about 6%.International shareholders make up about 18%.tshandup@sundaytimes.co.za
