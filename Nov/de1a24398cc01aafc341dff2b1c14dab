I love the textures, lines, colours and forms of the Kalahari. Being there feels like being on another planet or in a different realm. From the plants to the sky, the Kalahari is the most beautiful place I have visited.Travel gives me a sense of childlike wonder - it intensifies my senses, encourages me to notice details, and makes me feel excited and interested in the world around me.I try to travel for at least one month a year, and my favourite destinations include Istanbul, Amsterdam, Barcelona, London and Buenos Aires. Ceramics guru Anthony Shapiro on what inspires himSmell and taste inspire me and bring back memories of different experiences and places. As an adventurous eater, I'm always prepared to try something new, even if I don't try it again!Design and architecture from the Art Deco era, the '50s and the '70s, enthrall me, and I've always instinctively collected ceramics from these periods. There are so many amazing Art Deco buildings in Cape Town.The fashion, cars and furniture of the '50s are impeccable, and I am particularly fond of German ceramic vases and small town churches from the '70s.These are very special and I love the texture and earthy feel of Hagi ware. It originated in Korea and became fashionable for tea ceremonies and gifts after the Japanese abducted Hagi-ware craftsmen in the 16th century.</img>Gers's ceramics. Image: SuppliedGers's ceramics. Image: SuppliedThis is a great part of my life. The most interesting play I've seen is The Drowned Man, an immersive production by the British theatre company Punchdrunk.The members of the audience were all given masks, which made for a feeling of voyeuristic anonymity, and you could follow any part of the multi-layered story as it unfolded in a series of rooms over four floors of an enormous historic building.There are many artists who inspire me, but Francis Bacon's work is especially fascinating since I learnt about his eccentricities and life.
