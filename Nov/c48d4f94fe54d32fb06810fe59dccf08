The only team to go through a Premier League season without defeat were Arsenal themselves in 2003-04 and, even if only 10 matches have been played, victory today would end any slight chance of that feat being replicated.Theo Walcott, Santi Cazorla, Hector Bellerin and Nacho Monreal all stayed in London this week amid minor injuries and Arsenal's Champions League tie in Sofia against Ludogorets, but are all hopeful of being available to start the match.To the unsuspecting outsider, Arsenal and Tottenham's yearly showdowns might appear tame in comparison to the scenes of violence and mayhem associated with other high-profile derbies between the likes of Rangers and Celtic, Roma and Lazio or Manchester United and Liverpool.But for the supporters who drape themselves in the red of Arsenal or the white of Spurs, the fixture comes laced with fear and loathing.Peggy Goulding has been supporting the Gunners for more than 40 years, but the softly spoken chairman of Arsenal Football Supporters Club says the north London derby has an atmosphere of unrelenting menace."I hate this game. If you go to the away game, you feel like your life is in your hands," Goulding said. Klopp downplays Reds' lack-of-Europe advantageOff the field, Arsenal's move from Highbury to the Emirates Stadium in 2006 produced a change in their fan-base to a more gentrified group that draws from across the world and attracts many from the wealthier end of society.In contrast, Tottenham fans point to their more London-based working-class support, some of whom proudly celebrate the supposed Jewish heritage of many Spurs supporters, as proof that they provide a more authentic football experience.Whatever the next generation of Arsenal and Tottenham fan looks like from a sociological perspective, both sides of the divide can agree on one thing - the rivalry will continue to burn brightly."I don't think there is anything that will rival the Arsenal-Tottenham game. It's been going on for a long, long time. The hatred has been built up on both sides," Goulding said.Arsenal haven't lost in any competition since the opening day of the season and their midweek 3-2 win away to Ludogorets of Bulgaria, with marksman Mesut Ozil's superb solo goal completing a comeback from 2-0 down, has left the Gunners well-placed to qualify for the Champions League last 16.They may boast the Premier League's lone remaining unbeaten record and are just three points off top spot, but Spurs have not won any of their last six matches in all competitions.Spurs have not finished above Arsenal since 1995 .
