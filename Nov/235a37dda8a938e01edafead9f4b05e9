Even though SuperSport United needed penalties to end Mamelodi Sundowns Telkom Knockout Cup defence, last night s quarterfinal showed why these Tshwane clubs have annexed all the trophies available to them bar the Caf Confederations Cup, Super Cup and the MTN8.They may not fill stadiums but the football cuisine they served came fresh from the best coaching kitchen as compared to the stale fast food the masses have to content themselves with at the FNB Stadium.The Tshwane derby will never match its Soweto counterpart from an attendance perspective but there were things in this match absent from last week s paint-drying session: quality football, players willingness to win and a red card.SAFA reported to have made a R40-million lossAt least the pre-match warm-up controversy that headlined the first derby earlier this season did not rear its ugly head. Percy Tau s pacy and skilful trio of forays into the SuperSport box in the first seven minutes reminded Stuart Baxter of Sundowns superior mental strength and cohesion.Reneilwe Letsholonyane again reminded us of his enduring class with a high-calibre outing that asked questions of Hlompho Kekana and Tiyani Mabunda s defensive midfield resolve.United defender Onismor Bhasera incurred referee Victor Gomes s wrath in the 63rd minute and was sent off for dissent after being booked for a foul on Khama Billiat.Sundowns may have unexpectedly lost a home match last Sunday against Cape Town City, but they were still mentally sound to raise themselves for the big occasion.Having seen off Sundowns e a r ly torrent of pressure, United had their own chances from strikers Jeremy Brockie and Thuso Phala, with the former s 23rd-minute effort rattling the crossbar from a free kick.It would have been apt punishment for the hosts after Billiat skied what was a clear chance five minutes earlier after Tau again showed the United defence a clean pair of heels. Pirates bounce back in styleUnlike the rain showers that punctuated the late afternoon and early evening, at no stage did the match look like it was going to peter out into a tactical scrap.Sundowns tried to ram home their numerical advantage but United s refusal to buckle like they did in the fractious meeting on August 28 meant Downs had to work hard.The visitors were out to fight and for the first time in a domestic match this season, Sundowns were tested. If Brockie had not missed a 49thminute chance after Letsholonyane picked up a loose Wayne Arendse pass, the hosts could have been in trouble. The same applied for United when Kekana s 65th-minute free kick beat everyone but Ronwen Williams s right-hand upright.Had Letsholonyane s 92nd-minute chance found the net instead of the upright, with Kennedy Mweene prone on the ground after a collision, there would have been mayhem but the football gods played it safe.Far-side official Sandile Dilikane decided to put his stamp on the match when he incorrectly ruled out Anthony Laffor s 92nd-minute goal for offside. Whatever hopes the match had for a goal died with him.Mamelodi Sundowns (0) 0SuperSport United (0) 0United won 3-1 on penalties
