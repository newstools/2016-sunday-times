The NEC meeting, which is likely to be the last one for the year, is also expected to decide on a timeline to be followed by ANC branches as they hold general meetings to discuss policy issues and candidates to be considered to replace President Jacob Zuma next year.Secretary-general Gwede Mantashe said on Friday that party structures that intended to put forward names of candidates to be considered for leadership positions would now have to motivate for their nomination in a bid to eliminate "slate politics" where leadership positions are pre-determined by powerful party factions. 'I'm watching the real thieves'"It is required at branch level when they say I elect so and so for such position, they must explain it. Who is this person? What is the basis of electing him to that position? If we do that, we are dealing with the question of slate politics," Mantashe said.Various slates - a term used by ANC lobbyists to refer to a list of preferred leaders - have started circulating in various provinces among party members and this has become a source of division in the party.Mantashe said the party intended to deal with the succession debate differently this time, allowing branches to openly discuss names of preferred candidates to eliminate vested interests."If it is done openly, on the table, everybody is here, you actually deal with vested interests."The biggest concern is to have a conference that is divided ... where we go and fight over elections," Mantashe said.Mantashe said the party had started campaigning against the phenomenon of "members buying members" to win leadership contests."If I give you R20,000 quietly, who would prevent that? It is you. Your conscience would have to say that is a bribe and you will refuse to take it."That is why we are embarking on an education programme to raise the consciousness," he said.story_article_right2Two other members of the NEC, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they expected the meeting not to dwell too much on former public protector Thuli Madonsela's state capture report as it is likely to be referred for judicial review by Zuma.The ANC's national working committee is expected to report to the NEC that Madonsela's report was inconclusive and Zuma's supporters were expected to use this to quash any attempt at the meeting to discuss his removal from office before next year's conference.Meanwhile, ANC veterans opposed to Zuma's leadership of both the party and the country will have a chance to air their views with other leaders at a meeting with the NWC tomorrow.ANC spokesman Zizi Kodwa said on Friday that the NWC would hold a "special meeting" tomorrow morning ahead of its meeting with the ANC veterans.Veterans agreed to the meeting despite unhappiness among some who wanted to air their views with the top six officials of the party as opposed to the 26-member NWC.Frank Chikane, a member of the task team dealing with the affairs of the veterans, said on Thursday that he regarded the meeting with the leadership of the ANC as an "indication of progress" regarding efforts to raise concerns about the state of the party and the country.
