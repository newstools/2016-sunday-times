Images of those regions fill the walls - the architecture, the food, the customs.They sit alongside pictures of characters from Disney's newest series, Elena of Avalor, which draws from Latin and Hispanic traditions for the story of a princess who's finding her place in the animated world - and making history in the real world too.Why Dora kicks Barbie s perfect buttCreator Craig Gerber set Elena of Avalor in a fairytale land, giving the first Latina Disney princess a kingdom to rule after rescuing her people from an evil sorceress.It's fantasy rooted within real cultural touch-stones, says Gerber, and that's evident in each step of the creation process.It all starts with the story. As head writer Sylvia Cardenas Olivas explains, it begins with the writers, who, crucially, come from diverse backgrounds.In the writers' room, with its map of Avalor in the centre, stories and characters are fleshed out. "We start with the theme of a particular episode and take turns to pitch ideas."They take their ideas to Gerber, who gives his notes, from which the script is developed.Once that has been okayed by the network, the actors' voices record it, and then the story-board artists plot it out.The images are drawn to the voices. Robb Pratt leads a team of three artists, who each take a third of the episode to create what's called an animatic."It's like building a house," says Pratt. "You're setting up the blueprints, the plans, for each shot before it goes to the animators."It usually takes six weeks to story-board a show."If you look at a film like Frozen, they spend three to five years making the movie. The first year alone is just developing the visual look of the film."Adds Gerber: "Each Elena episode takes 18 months from beginning to end."WATCH a trailer for Elena of Avalor While character designer Ritsuko Notaniimmerses herself in aspects of Latin culture to help her plot out new faces, the backgrounds are designed and painted by artists.Finally, before it goes to the animation studios [one in France and one in Canada], editor Margaret Holzendorf gets the boards and cuts them together to see how it all plays.It's a rigorous process, she says, but a passionate one."We're constantly tweaking everything and making it better, right up until we're forced to give it over to the network!"Gerber adds: "This is a big passion project for a lot of people. There's a sense that this is an important show, that Elena is an important princess."The joy and dedication seen through the creation process is all the evidence needed to see this is true. 'Elena of Avalor' is on Disney Channel (DStv channel 303) on Saturdays and Sundays at 8.25am.
