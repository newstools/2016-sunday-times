Umgeni Water - the largest supplier of bulk potable water in KwaZulu-Natal - met with five major municipalities last week to outline a proposed tariff increase from July next year.The suggested hike - which is yet to be approved by the National Treasury and the Department of Water and Sanitation - is largely to fund the R17-billion uMkhomazi water project. Construction is scheduled to start in two years and be completed by 2023. Brewery where the purest drink on tap is HOMunicipalities have expressed concern about the proposed hike."Municipalities have pointed out there is likely to be resistance from consumers," said Umgeni Water spokesman Shami Harichunder."However, Umgeni Water explained in detail the composition of the proposed tariff and the vital importance of the uMkhomazi water project to secure eThekwini's water resources in future."The primary aim of the project, he said, was to address dwindling water resources as a result of the drought and to meet the needs of an increasingly urban population.The department said in a report that the proposed project "appears to be the most attractive option for ensuring that the longer-term water needs of the region are satisfied".

This deficit will increase to as much as 202 million litres per annum in 2040 and hence an augmentation option is definitely required."One of the major benefits of the project is that it will bring into use new water from an underutilised source."
