Julius Malema has every right to question the National Prosecuting Authority's decision to charge him with incitement based on apartheid-era legislation that has no place in a democracy.But he has no right to threaten citizens, no matter their skin colour, with violence.His remarks that the EFF was not calling for the slaughter of whites - "just yet" - is the kind of racist and reckless ranting that puts him up there with demagogues such as Uganda's Idi Amin and Zimbabwe's Hitler Hunzvi.
