Plenty of the world's leading players already ply their trade in England and, with top-flight clubs benefiting from a new 5-billion-plus three-year broadcast deal, that influx of talent is set to continue.However, the Premier League cannot boast either of the two players widely regarded to be the best on the planet - Barcelona ace Messi and Real Madrid star Ronaldo.story_article_left1While Manchester City have been linked with a move for Messi, Pochettino cannot see that fact changing, but he does believe the Premier League's spending power means the next elite players will head to England.He told Spanish newspaper Marca: "These types of players do not come around every day or every year. Real Madrid and Barcelona already have them and nobody is going to take them away."But, with the financial power that the clubs have, the next Messi or Ronaldo will play in England."The talent will come to England soon, in fact, it is already arriving." Asked if Spurs can win the title, the former Espanyol and Southampton boss said:"We're still unbeaten and last season we were very, very close."With some fortune, luck or better finishing we could be in first place now."If we maintain our level and we improve in some aspects, I'm sure that we are going to be up there," the Tottenham manager said.
