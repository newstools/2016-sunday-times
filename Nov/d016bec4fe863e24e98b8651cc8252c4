The All Share index shed 2% on the week to close below the 50,000-point mark for the first time since late February.Industrial stocks led the losses, but platinum and gold stocks held on to gains, thanks to higher commodity prices.Market sentiment took strain after opinion polls showed a tight race between Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and her Republican rival, Donald Trump. Clinton is seen as maintaining the status quo."The prospect of a Trump presidency, it seems, is a much greater risk for investors than a measly 0.25% rate hike next month," said Oanda senior market analyst Craig Erlam. Rand is better but the ratings agencies loomMajor benchmark indices from Asia to Europe and the US were mostly weaker in late Friday trade.The race to the White House overshadowed the country's nonfarm payrolls report, which showed that the world's largest economy created 161,000 jobs in October, down from a revised 191,000 in September."The average of the latest polls gives Clinton a 1.7 percentage point lead over Trump. This is down meaningfully from a week ago but still solid enough to give her a 70% probability of winning," said Rand Merchant Bank currency strategist John Cairns."The market nevertheless worries that a simple hiccup could see a further swing behind Trump and is reflecting this via very nervous trade."The rand weakened to around R13.62/$ late on Friday, paring gains made earlier in the week when it rallied to highs of R13.31/$ as President Jacob Zuma withdrew his court bid to halt the release of the public protector's report on state capture.Another key feature this week was the resurgence of the pound after the UK High Court ruled that the UK could not trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty to exit the EU without consulting parliament.The ruling, which the UK government said it would appeal, boosted the pound against the rand and the dollar. JSE-listed stocks with UK exposure also benefited.
