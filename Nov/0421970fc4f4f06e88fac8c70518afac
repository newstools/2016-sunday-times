Ross Brawn said there had been a lot of false speculation about the condition of the seven-time world champion and that the Schumacher family had made the decision long ago that the best strategy was to keep private about his condition.Schumacher sustained severe head injuries in a skiing accident in December 2013 in the Alpine resort of Meribel and there have been several contradictory reports about his condition ever since."The family have chosen to conduct Michael's convalescence in private and I must respect that," Brawn told the BBC."There are encouraging signs and we are all praying every day that we see more of them. So it is difficult for me to say very much and respect the family's privacy."All I would say is there is a lot of speculation about Michael's condition."Most of it is wrong and we just pray and hope every day that we continue to see some progress."It emerged in September that Schumacher still cannot walk or stand unaided. The information was disclosed as part of court proceedings in Germany.Schumacher's family are suing a German magazine over a report last year which claimed he could walk again."He cannot walk," Felix Damm, a lawyer representing Schumacher, told a court hearing in Hamburg.
