One of the devastating tragedies he suffered while imprisoned there was the death of his eldest son in a car accident. He was refused permission to attend his funeral.The wellbeing of children was always uppermost in his mind, and after his release he worked tirelessly to improve their lot.The opening of the Mandela Children's Hospital in Parktown, Johannesburg, on Friday is therefore a particularly touching homage to our greatest leader and the sacrifices he made. It is South Africa's second hospital catering exclusively to children, after the Red Cross Children's Hospital in Cape Town. Joburg set to get SA's second hospital dedicated exclusively to childrenThe state-of-the-art facility, which cost R1-billion to build and equip, will be free to those who cannot afford it. Most of the operating theatres will have video technology allowing doctors to watch or participate in surgeries from anywhere in the world.There will be a bed for a parent next to that of each patient and free accommodation for families who live far away. The hospital is intended for the sickest children requiring specialised care.But how exactly will it be funded?While the hospital will hold a ribbon-cutting ceremony this week, attended by Gra a Machel, it won't open its doors to sick children until about June next year, as the National Treasury will only allocate an operating budget in March.Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi is on record as saying the state will fund 100% of the running costs. We need clarity and certainty on this question: this cannot become a white elephant. In the meantime, let's cheer this inspirational project and those who helped realise Mandela's vision. We hope this hospital will be admired globally for excellence.
