A bank has ordered the auction of a six-bedroom mansion in Clifton, with a minimum opening bid of R50-million.Property mogul Stuart Chait, who co-founded MvelaProp with Tokyo Sexwale and had a stake in stylish Melrose Arch in Johannesburg, said Sasfin Bank had been a partner in the development of the house, which has never-ending views of the Atlantic Ocean.But now the bank considered it "too big an exposure on their books" and had decided "not to extend the loan".Move aside foreign buyers - Gautengers splurge R350-million on luxury Cape Town padsThe house, with six bedrooms, eight bathrooms and an elevator, is on Nettleton Road - often dubbed the most expensive street in the country where celebrities and oil barons frolic. It has been on the market for months for R150-million.But upon Sasfin's instruction, House 3, as it is known, will be auctioned on November 24.Joff van Reenen, lead auctioneer and director of The High St Auction Co, would not comment on the impasse."A legal process is being followed and we've been instructed by the financial institution concerned," was all Van Reenen had to say.The Sunday Times has established that the home has whetted the appetites of several well-heeled buyers from around the world.The auction is set to take place at Summer Place in Hyde Park and will be streamed live."In order to secure our position, we already have a third-party offer to purchase from a willing and able purchaser, and we await their guarantees, which covers our exposure to the bank," Chait told the Sunday Times."This is also underpinned by the reserve price at the auction. The bank, however, has a profit-share arrangement in the loan, and we can only assume that they are holding out for a higher price in order to realise their profit share. We also agree that it is worth more than the debt."Houses in Clifton currently sell for R100,000-R120,000 a square metre [measured as internal built area], and House 3 measures approximately 1380m internally, and 2200m of total built space."It is also unique as it is situated in Clifton's only gated estate, and is lateral in its layout. Properties in this area are in high demand and the market is strong. Recently, a property was sold nearby for R290-million. Holding out for an unrealistic price could prove costly in the long run if the home spends an inordinate amount of time for sale and it becomes stale "If Sasfin had elected to extend the loan and allowed the property to sell over this summer season, I'm sure we would have achieved our market value price of R150-million, as houses at this price level generally take time to sell."Chait, the executive chairman of Land Equity Group, started his first business at the age of 18, selling cut flowers to retailers.According to the company's website he has "built a strong and public track record of conceptualising and realising value in property".In an interview published by Business Day in 2005, Chait detailed his plans to develop Nettleton Ridge estate. Clifton had the "most prestigious and expensive" property on the continent, he said.At the time he said the development would target some of the richest people in the world, including politicians, actors and business tycoons with a net worth exceeding R500-million.</img>Stuart Chait, chairman of Land Equity.
