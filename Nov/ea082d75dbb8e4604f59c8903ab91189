The governing body was told of the scope of Fifa's disciplinary proceedings on Thursday which, it is understood, could include other events around the match such as the minute's silence and playing of The Last Post as well as potentially the poppy T-shirts given out to the crowd and the poppy imagery on the stadium screens.National associations are obliged to request officially from Fifa the right to have a minute's silence before a game. The FA obtained Fifa permission for a minute's silence and permission for England players to wear the poppy-embroidered armbands for an international friendly against Spain in November 2011.Fifa has a strictly prescribed pre-match itinerary for international matches to which it expects national associations to adhere.FIFA chief promises clean 2026 WCup bidFifa has also confirmed that disciplinary proceedings have been opened against the Scottish FA, whose players also wore poppies embroidered on their armbands for the game against England.A Fifa spokesman refused to specify the terms of the disciplinary proceedings against the two governing bodies or what they would encompass other than just the poppies on the armbands, which is certain to form part of the charge.Instead, the Fifa spokesman simply confirmed that the proceedings had begun, which both the FA and the SFA expected.The Fifa spokesman said: "We can confirm that disciplinary proceedings have been opened on this matter. We cannot comment further at this stage."Greg Clarke, the FA chairman, said in the build-up to the game that it would be "inconceivable" for the England team not to wear poppies for the match which fell on November 11, Armistice Day. The SFA followed suit. The Football Association of Wales did not, saying that it could not risk the points deduction that could be imposed by Fifa.The assumption by both the FA and the SFA is that Fifa will fine them, although there are no guarantees that the punishment will not be more severe than that. From Fifa's point of view, a points deduction is likely to cause a major diplomatic row although that sanction would be within its power.Before the game last week at Wembley Stadium Fifa said it had reminded the FA and the SFA of law four, paragraph four of its rules which prohibits players from wearing "political, religious or personal slogans, statements or images".Martin Glenn, the FA chief executive, challenged Fifa to sanction the FA, saying that the governing body would stand up to any disciplinary proceedings with a "rock solid" case.The UK Prime Minister, Theresa May, said that it would be "utterly outrageous" for Fifa to prevent the England team from wearing poppies.
