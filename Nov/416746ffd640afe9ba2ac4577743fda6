The proposed national minimum wage of R3500 per month was presented to the National Economic Development and Labour Council (Nedlac) by a panel of advisors on Sunday and public announcement made by Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa. Minimum wage ought to be R5,000 and above : ANCYLNumsa general secretary Irvin Jim said the union was extremely disgusted by the mission of the African National Congress (ANC) and Ramaphosa to legislate slavery wages maintain super-exploitation of black and African labour under the disguise of national minimum wage . Numsa is convinced that Ramaphosa is extremely dangerous continually gunning for the blood of the working class and ready to evaporate the dream of a living national minimum wage he added.Jim also took aim at the Congress of South African Trade Unions and Federation of Unions of South Africa calling them open collaborators with this right-wing conservative agenda . In the recent past we have witnessed the leaders of both federations running around with minister of finance reassuring rating agencies promising them heaven on earth and making commitments without being able to explain what brings the leadership of workers into such a relationship with rating agencies if not making commitments that are selling out workers he said.Minimum wage 'too low' We are particularly angered by the fact that these federations have been participating in meetings where they debated a national minimum wage between R 3700 and R4500. Quite frankly these figures say it all - that both government and business have not been serious and that's why we reject the stance of these federations whose leaders now going back to workers with insulting proposals and then pretending to be shocked with the R3500 recommendation.
