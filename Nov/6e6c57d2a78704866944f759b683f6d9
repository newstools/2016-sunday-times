From its opening moments, the second film from Warner Brothers' in-house Animation Group goes about its work with all the thoughtful composure of a flailing hosepipe in an old slapstick two-reeler. But after softening you up, it lands on its emotional target- we're talking freely trickling tears - with a persuasive and satisfying thud. App enlivens classics for kidsWarner Animation Group's only other film to date was 2014's The Lego Movie, which pulled off this exact trick with a flair and precision that surprised almost everybody. Storks can't quite match its sheer breakneck inventiveness, but it's still a densely funny, lovingly orchestrated 90 minutes of amiable chaos.Storks' premise has the same absurd-but-topical fizz: until recently, storks were mainly known for delivering babies - but a few years ago, the birds caught the updraft of the e-commerce boom, and now run an Amazon-like retail giant called Cornerstore.com, which distributes everything but.The storks' now-obsolete baby machine is gathering dust in a warehouse - or it is until Tulip (Katie Crown), a human orphan raised by the storks thanks to a workplace mishap, reactivates it.The poppet who pops out must be delivered to her rightful parents, so Tulip commits to the task, with help from her (stork) manager Junior (Andy Samberg), who's anxious to shield his exacting boss Hunter (Kelsey Grammer) from this unfolding disaster.WATCH the trailer for Storks:StorkTheir ensuing door-to-door odyssey zings with the spirit of silliness Warner Animation Group would do well to make its trademark. (The directors are Nicholas Stoller, aka the Bad Neighbors and Forgetting Sarah Marshall guy, and Doug Sweetland, a former animator at Pixar.) Take Tulip and Junior's ongoing feud with a wolf pack, whose group instinct is so attuned they can "form up" like the cartoon robot Voltron into various advantageous shapes.It's a visual joke that brings the house down as wolves are wont to do - partly because the concept is so offbeat, also because the animation is so precise.Waiting at the other end is Nate (Anton Starkman), a young boy hoping for a playmate to spend the kind of quality time with him that his workaholic parents (Jennifer Aniston and Ty Burrell) slowly learn to spare.There's a nod here to the modern workplace's ravenous encroachment on family life that might cause twinges of guilty recognition among parents in the audience - a concept that's of course taken to lunatic extremes in the storks' own hyper-productive and baby-free organisation.Storks doesn't labour the point - it's a pea of sentiment beneath many mattresses-worth of lunacy - but its prickle comes through sharp and clear. - The Daily Telegraph, LondonRATING: 4/5 stars 'Storks' is on circuit.
