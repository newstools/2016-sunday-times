Kobus Marais, of the SA Sports Association for the Physically Disabled (SASAPD), was elected in 2012 and 2008, while Jerry Segwaba, Free State Sports Confederation president, served as a co-opted member for the past four years.Both have cried foul.Sascoc president Gideon Sam said he needed to learn the reasons for the disqualifications."If they don't qualify, does it mean we've been having a board that is not correct?" asked Sam.Sascoc lawyer Raymond Hack said he was happy to comment, but only with the permission of CEO Tubby Reddy, who couldn't be reached by the Sunday Times yesterday.In total, 11 people - some standing for multiple posts - were disqualified. Marais and Segwaba were among the nine excluded for ordinary board member positions, as was soccer administrator Ria Ledwaba, who didn't sign an acceptance form, Sascoc said in a circular to members.Among the new faces for the November 26 poll is Athletics SA president Aleck Skhosana, while veterans include newly elected SA Rugby boss Mark Alexander, who is also standing as vice-president.Three of six vice-president nominees were deemed ineligible.Four of six deputy president hopefuls were discarded, leaving just two candidates in the running for Sascoc's second-most powerful position - incumbent Hajera Kajee and Jace Naidoo of Swimming SA.Kajee is also standing against Sam for the presidency.If elected for a third time, Sam wouldn't serve out the full four years because Sascoc board members must step down after turning 70, which in his case would be in 2019.The Sascoc circular gave reasons for each disqualification; Marais and Segwaba were not members of national sports federations.Marais denied this, pointing out that his organisation selected the athletics team for the Rio Paralympics. "Somewhere, someone is either not knowing what SASAPD [does] ... or they are busy with ulterior motives."He and Segwaba said they were challenging their disqualifications."I believe people have got vendettas," said Segwaba, adding he was nominated in 2012 without objection, but withdrew before the voting on the understanding he would be co-opted.
