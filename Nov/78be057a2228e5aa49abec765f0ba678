A country's failure to implement the reforms proposed by the task force could have a significant impact on its position in the global economy, making international trade more expensive due to the stricter application of rules against money laundering and terrorism financing. This can have the effect of making it impossible to do business with the country at all.Lawson Naidoo, the executive secretary of the Council for the Advancement of the South African Constitution , said: "We'll be monitored by international banks and there's a real danger that South African banks will lose their correspondence banking status with banks in other parts of the world, particularly where they have a stringent regulatory framework."The amended legislation includes guidance on measures relating to risk management, with a special focus on enhanced due diligence when institutions deal with politically exposed persons.

A reluctance to co-operate with the task force to remedy those weaknesses results in the country being monitored by the International Co-operation Review Group, a branch of the Financial Action Task Force.The review group "identifies potentially higher-risk countries and works with them to address these weaknesses", said Wijmenga-Daniel.It also issues public warnings about the specific risks emanating from the country, to help protect the global financial system. This puts pressure on countries to implement the necessary reforms.Among the key differences between money laundering and terror financing was that the former was processed through the formal financial system while the latter moved through other channels."The preference, originally, in terror financing was the informal financial system. However, the speed and the effectiveness of the formal system makes it really attractive for terrorists to use," said Tersia Rossouw, a partner in KPMG's risk consulting and forensic department.What makes terror financing more difficult to track, apart from sanctions screening, is that terror groups deal with smaller amounts than those engaged in money-laundering activities. Between 2013 and 2015, the number of foreign counterparties in South Africa declined by 10.1%, falling from 2163 to 1965 Money launderers create complex webs of transactions to hide the money, whereas terror financing is usually straightforward.With South Africa being the only African country that is a member of the task force, losing international banking relationships would have repercussions not only for it but for banks across the continent.Angola, Liberia and Guinea offer examples of the devastating impact the inability to trade internationally has on a country's banking system and economy.Angola has only one correspondent bank, Deutsche Bank, and only it can clear US dollars in the country.Standard Chartered has limited the number of services it provides to Angola to a handful of clients.These include the central bank and the Sonangol Group, a US company that manages Angola's oil and gas reserves.To get access to foreign currency, Angolan banks have to go through South African or Portuguese banks, making it more expensive to process transactions.

Commercial banks have borne the brunt of these challenges," said Cashin.
