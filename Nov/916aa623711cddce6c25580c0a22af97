But he is well on his way to entering his name among the elite league, the best to ever grace the game.Phillippe Coutinho makes my pulse beat faster than the speed of light.The little Magician makes me lose my mind akin to a child in a candy shop.With every game, be it for club or country, Coutinho's stock seems to be rising faster than cake flour.The twinkle-toed one is in fine form. The state of Ertugral's capture by his cowardiceThe Liverpool midfielder has started the season strongly in a 4x4 mood - in excellent early season form, he has four goals and four assists in eight games thus far for the red side of Merseyside.Coutinho is not one with a bagful of goals in his games for Brazil.But when he gets them, he adds a catalogue of gems in his repertoire.Cue Belo Horizonte in the wee hours of Friday morning - against Argentina, in a 2018 World Cup qualifier.There's this trademark goal in particular which, when he scores, is sensational.It is a typical Coutinho goal, one that usually leaves goalkeepers clutching at straws in the air.He collects the ball on the left, cuts inside and hammers home.When he pulled it off in the 25th minute, he raised the roof at the venue, setting the Selecao on course to a stunning defeat of the visiting sworn enemy.He was the bullet supplier for the Suarez and Sturridge strike force.He works in tandem with the roaring Senegalese lion of Teranga, Sadio Man , and his homeboy Roberto Firmino.He has dislodged Willian from the Selecao starting berth.Coach Tite has been captured by Coutinho's captivating contributions."Why Coutinho instead of Willian? There's a reason he is called the Magician by Liverpool fans."It was a difficult decision for me [dropping Willian], but right now this is Coutinho's moment.
