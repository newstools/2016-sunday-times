We honour Khewzi s memory today. It is the same morally crooked ruling party who chased young female protesters who stood in her honour earlier this year at the IEC Centre. While this morally bankrupt ruling party now fights for its own survival while focusing its efforts solely on protecting President Zuma the critical issues affecting women and children will continue to take a back seat."EFF member Delisile Ngwenya meanwhile pointed to problematic examples in the ANC leadership citing Western Cape ANC leader Marius Fransman who was found guilty by the party for attempting to obtain sexual favours and Sports Minister Fikile Mbalula who "insulted a woman he had sex with by calling her a one night stand".Freedom Front Plus MP Pieter Groenewald however said it was "no use blaming political parties or the police or social workers" for violence against women and children when it was up to the individual."If you have self respect you will respect women and children " he said.Minister Susan Shabangu said the ANC was the only party actively working towards legislation to protect women and children.She said the party welcomed the sentence against Wisani saying the party "can't tolerate any abuse".- TMG Digital/Parliamentary Bureau
