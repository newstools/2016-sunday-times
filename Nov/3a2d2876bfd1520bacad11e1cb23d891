Q: I experience premature ejaculation. Is there medication to deal with this? It is affecting my relationship.A: This is a common problem. Although there is no definition of how long sex should last, a study looking at 500 couples from five countries found the average time taken to ejaculate during penetrative vaginal intercourse was around five and a half minutes.In the many consultations I have done, a fair number of men had an unrealistic expectation of how long a round of sex should last. Many people exaggerate their performance, and this may put unnecessary pressure on an otherwise normal experience.Sex Talk: Is not having sex for a long time healthy?With that said, one needs to establish what you mean by "premature ejaculation" because self-diagnosis and self-medication is common in men.Occasional episodes of premature ejaculation are common and are not a cause for concern. Various psychological and physical factors can cause it: prostate problems, thyroid problems (which men often fail to screen for), use of recreational drugs, mood disorders, stress, relationship problems, anxiety about sexual performance (particularly at the start of a new relationship, or when a man has had previous performance problems), attitude to sex, et cetera.You may benefit from couples therapy, and a referral to reputable sources to aid with techniques to delay ejaculation.Always seek the advice of your doctor and discuss with them appropriate medications. Sometimes an issue might have more than one cause and a multi-disciplinary team may be required.
