A trio of headers from Daniel Sturridge, Adam Lallana and Gary Cahill secured a 3-0 victory that kept England top of their World Cup qualifying group and added an air of inevitability to Southgate being promoted from his interim role.The buildup to Friday's Group F encounter was filled with reports that the Football Association were already minded to hand him the job, barring an embarrassing defeat in the latest instalment of the oldest rivalry in international football. Jos 'dismayed' at Manchester United's cultureYet with that hurdle safely overcome and his rivals for the position having all seemingly dropped by the wayside, the route is now clear for the former Middlesbrough and England under-21 boss to be installed."I have loved it and enjoyed the role and responsibility, the challenge of every part of it," Southgate, who was initially appointed for four games, told reporters after Friday's victory.Southgate's elevation to odds-on favourite for the role is remarkable given he was not in the running when Sam Allardyce was appointed in July for his short reign.While his coronation is unlikely to generate much excitement among fans - he has only ever managed one club, Middlesbrough, who sacked him after three years following relegation - his stock at the FA is high.He has become part of the furniture at English football's governing body, having successfully led the under-21s and now steered the senior team through turmoil in the wake of Allardyce's departure after 67 days following a newspaper sting.With rivals for the role seemingly thin on the ground, Southgate will feel justified in assuming he has done enough to see off the threat posed by Bournemouth's Eddie Howe, former Manchester City boss Roberto Mancini and Aston Villa's Steve Bruce, all touted as possible alternatives.Critics will say he has faced no serious test in his three matches, but he has steered a listing ship in choppy waters and is warming to the task."I get that it isn't as enjoyable if you don't win but it's been a brilliant experience and I have taken so much from it, we have created a good environment," he said.Sturridge's bullet header in the first half and impressive efforts after the break from Lallana and Cahill ensured England emerged having consolidated their Group F lead.It was not the one-sided romp the scoreline suggests and England only pulled clear in the second half having survived some nervy moments."Tonight is down to the players. They have shown what they are capable of," he told reporters - though keen to stress his side had almost been the architects of their own downfall when Scotland put them under pressure in the second half.For his counterpart Gordon Strachan, though, the future looks increasingly bleak, his side sitting second bottom on the log with four points.However, he was adamant that he would not be rushed into decisions about his role."If you think I'm thinking about myself now, or worrying about myself, you don't know me," was his response to questions about his future. Wenger fears Chile S nchez callStrachan had made sweeping changes to the side that lost to Slovakia and had clearly set his team up to make England uncomfortable. It worked until the 24th minute.A sprawling Scottish defender blocked Raheem Sterling's shot, but the ball fell kindly for Kyle Walker whose driven cross was angled superbly into the net by a stooping Sturridge.Having broken the visitors' resistance, England conspired to hand them a route back two minutes later but defender Grant Hanley headed over the bar when unmarked.That was the first of a series of let-offs for England, who survived two heart-in-mouth moments at the start of the second half when James Forrest pulled a shot hideously wide from 10m and Robert Snodgrass had one blocked from a similar range.Within moments, however, England put the encounter to bed showing the sort of quality in front of goal Scotland had lacked, as Danny Rose's cross from the left found Lallana on the penalty spot to head powerfully past Craig Gordon.England's third arrived on 60 minutes as Wayne Rooney's corner found Cahill, who flashed his near-post header past Gordon and into the far corner.The defeat was already ensured, but England should have rubbed further salt into Scotland's wounds. Sterling scooped over from almost under the crossbar.
