Calgro, which is largely responsible for affordable housing infrastructure such as RDP housing, would have returned an astonishing R150,000 over five years on an investment of R10,000 on September 1 2011.This equates to a compound annual growth rate of 71.9% from September 1 2011 to August 31 2016.The company said that diversifying into other income groups and the private sector had paid off because it had to adapt to the changing market where most people were renting instead of owning property. Government's helping hand to business 'vital in hard times'MD Wikus Lategan said the restructuring of the company, introducing the Captain Calgro programme and the low reliance on the government, had kept the business afloat."We really think that we de-risked the group. We have done well for the consumers in terms of what products are out there," Lategan said.He said South Africa had a housing backlog of about 2.1million in the "affordable housing" bracket and although it had private clients to keep the order book going, Calgro was still going to help the government to meet the demand.However, John Loos, property analyst at FNB, said although the affordable market was slightly better than other property segments in recent years, growth was still slow.He said the rhetoric about unlimited demand and huge supply shortages was untrue because demand was driven by whether people could afford to buy a house or get a home loan."Affordable housing is performing slightly better than the market higher up - our low-income metro price index," Loos said.The company has 12 projects on the ground, equating to roughly R22-billion. It has also launched a real estate investment trust, Reit, in collaboration with SA Corporate Real Estate, which will focus on South Africa's affordable rental market.It will acquire new units to be developed in Johannesburg and Cape Town for about R1.6-billion and hopes to build up to around R10-billion to R15-billion worth of property in the next five years. This is about 30,000 rental units."What that will mean is we will play both sides of the interest rate cycle: if interest rates come down people will buy more property and if interest rates come up people will be able to afford the rent."So again we have safeguarded the company from macroeconomic impacts," Lategan said.In the past few years the working class has been migrating to cities to be closer to work. Lategan said this phenomenon was an opportunity the company had seized - it was building affordable rental spaces in metro CBDs.

We have an economy that is not growing, the growth is insignificant and job prospects don't look great. The economic problem plays a major part in the housing problem," Loos said.Calgro also has a project in the Namibian capital, Windhoek.Lategan said that although growth would be stagnant for the rest of the year he was optimistic about next year.
