Robert Forsyth of Kedar Heritage Lodge in North West is fascinated by SA history, specifically the Anglo-Boer War (1899-1902).He has turned the lodge into a private museum, building up the biggest collection of memorabilia from the war in the world.The lodge is on Boekenhoutsfontein, the private farm of Paul Kruger before and while he was president of the ZAR (South African Republic, ie the Transvaal).KwaZulu-Natal: Mountains and battlesKruger was, of course, at the centre of the war.Much of the fighting happened in the western part of the then-Transvaal, specifically in and around the Magaliesberg. There are about 53 sites of battles and skirmishes in the area.From the entrance hall to the dining and conference rooms and the bar, Kedar is packed with the relics of war: rifles, bayonets, scabbards, walking sticks, flags, uniforms, letters, paintings, maps and more.Every Heritage Day, the lodge unveils a new statue of an important person in SA history.This year it was Sol Plaatje, writer, linguist, politician and a founding member of the SA Native National Congress in 1912, which later became the ANC. The s culpture, by Adam Madebe, has him sitting thoughtfully on a stoep .Nearby are statues of Mahatma Gandhi, a stretcher-bearer during the war, and General Jan Smuts, who was a Boer commander. In the lush gardens there are statues of Kruger and Kgosi Tumagole August Mokgatle, king of the Bafokeng 1891-1896, and a friend of Kruger.The lodge this year unveiled a gun used by the British at the battle of Dwarsvlei in the Magaliesberg on July 11 1900.Forsyth says he is not that interested in the facts of the war ."I'm interested in the little stories, human potential and bravery."Such tales are hinted at in display cases of letters to and from the POW camps in India and Ceylon, all with stickers showing they were "opened under Martial Law". There is a postcard from General Pieter Cronje who was imprisoned with his family on the island of St Helena.A prized exhibit is the hip-flask of Lieutenant General Lord Methuen, who was wounded and then captured by Koos de la Rey at the Battle of Tweebosch in March 1902, the only British General captured in the war.De la Rey sent Methuen to a British hospital in Krugersdorp in his own carriage, and was court-martialled for doing so.At the base of a koppie a few hundred metres from the lodge stands Kruger's houses, perfectly preserved. He bought the farm in 1859. His original 1839-40 mud-and-thatch cottage is still there, the oldest settler home in the former Transvaal.Kruger built a second, bigger cottage known as the Hartebeeshuisie in 1862. It, too, still stands with floors of mud and blood inlaid with peach pips.</img>The Sol Plaatje statue, unveiled at Kedar Heritage Lodge on Heritage Day 2016.

Image: Andrew Unsworth.The fact that he and his second wife Gezina had 16 children explains why there was a third house built in 1873 in a classic Eastern Cape style: a rectangular fa ade, a flat roof, a row of rooms with no passage, earthen floors and ceiling beams fastened by dowels and leather straps without the use of nails.Guide David Dewah shows people around the houses at least once a day and takes them up the koppie where Kruger went to pray daily, sometimes in the company of King Mokgatle."He sent two of the king's sons to the Netherlands to study," he says, "and Kruger built a schoolhouse which doubled as a church where all the local kids, black and white, simply learned to read and write."In that schoolhouse he points out the original corrugated iron roof, one side with flatter corrugations than the other."Kruger had ordered the iron for the roof but when it came there was not enough," he explains, "so he used a team of oxen to stretch it. And that's where the expression 'n boer maak a plan comes from."You certainly need a plan to take in all that Kedar offers in a weekend. It has 66 rooms a lot more comfortable than Kruger's, good food, a pool and a spa.But above all, the farm and the district are steeped in history. It is simply unique.
