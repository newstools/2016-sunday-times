The EFF rejected the Presidency s statement calling on Madonsela to stop speaking publicly about the State of Capture report. Adv Madonsela has discharged her duties as the public protector and has no further role to play in the process regarding the said report " the Presidency said in a statement issued on Friday morning. "It would be prudent therefore for the former public protector to step back and allow legal and constitutional processes to unfold unhindered."The EFF said the Presidency s plea was an attack on her basic right to freedom of speech. Ernest Mabuza We want to warn Zuma to stop using the name of the Presidency to defend his personal interests and unethical conduct EFF spokesman Mbuyiseni Ndlozi said.Ndlozi said the fact that Madonsela was the former public protector did not mean her freedom of expression and speech must be suspended or violated. She has the right to speak about the State of Capture report anyway and anywhere she wants. In fact particularly now that she is no longer in that office she ought to be considered fully as an ordinary citizen of this country who must as all other citizens do reflect on the work of the office of the public protector and Zuma himself. Ndlozi said Madonsela must continue to express herself on any matter published by the office of the public protector including reports published before during and after her tenure. This is the cornerstone of our democratic practice that must never be violated.
