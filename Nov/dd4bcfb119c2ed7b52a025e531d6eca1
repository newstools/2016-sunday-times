City share leadership of the league with Bidvest Wits and are now off to a cup final in a spectacular opening five months of business since John Comitis bought the franchise of Mpumalanga Black Aces.It was a seventh win in a row for the side coached by Eric Tinkler who totally dominated a Stars side who haven't won in the league yet, and can now concentrate on getting themselves off the foot of the league table.A combination of wastefulness in front of goal and stellar goalkeeping by Thela Ngobeni kept City's lead to just a goal at half-time but the final score reflected their superiority.At times City carved up the Stars defence with a power display of pace on attack and should have had the outcome secured inside 45 minutes.They took the lead from a 10th- minute penalty after a wild tackle by Stars captain Katlego Mashego.Lebohang Manyama tucked it away for the lead and then City got going with their attack, spurred by the masterful passing and cerebral ability of Manyama.But Ngobeni denied Sibusiso Masina and Ngoma in quick succession and then made another brilliant save to deny Masina again.Ngoma also squandered chances with poor shooting, as did Thamsanqa Mkhize from close range.But it was no surprise when City went 2-0 up after a defensive howler. Davis Nkausu played a clearance out of central defence straight at Manyama, who set up Roland Putsche with a back-heel. The Austrian drilled it low and hard, beating Ngobeni.City had 14 shots at goal in the first half, nine on target.But instead of wrapping up the result early, Masina gave away a free kick on the edge of the box in the 38th minute and Thokozani Sekotlong curled a stunning free kick over the wall to pull a goal back.A similar free kick just after the hour mark saw City restore their two-goal advantage.The talismanic Manyama went off soon after with an ankle injury that put a damper on the home's side's victory.Judas Moseamedi set up Ngoma for the fourth .
