With his youngest son Thato nagging him to go to the shopping mall, SuperSport United midfielder Reneilwe Letsholonyane was able to reassure him that they will be going there in a few minutes.It is the kind of patience that comes with age and experience. It drives the 34-year-old to great heights despite his advancing football age.After all, four-year-old Thato and his sisterKeneilwe, 9, are the reason why Letsholonyane wants to be more than just an onfield role model. Two Thulanis save the day for Shakes "The reason why I wake up early in the mornings and make sure I give 100% in whatever I do is because I know how it feels to be a child and not have someone to look up to," said Letsholonyane."I want our kids to know they don't need to look further than home for role models because Mpho [Maboi] and I are here for them."Mpho wakes up early in the morning and goes to work for them, and I do the same. It's about them understanding the value of hard work and how rewarding it can be."There's nothing more fulfilling than knowing your parents wake up early every day and make sure they work hard for you."You know nothing comes easy and build the work ethic while they're still young because a work ethic is something you don't lose. The last thing you want is your children to face the same challenges that you did growing up. We must fight some battles and pave the way for them so they don't have to fight unnecessary battles."The unforgiving nature of South African professional football doesn't afford footballers the time to pursue extracurricular activities.However, spiritual fulfilment is something "Yeye" always tries to find through his involvement with the Methodist Church Men's Guild in Meadowlands, Soweto.His schedule does not allow him to attend every Sunday, but it's part of what keeps his feet on the ground."God humbles you, helps you to make the right decisions and helps you to think things through."Taking my spiritual journey seriously helps me to tackle the difficult moments and I know everything will be alright. Tough times don't last, but tough people do and that's something I subscribe to. I try by all means to go to church when I have the time," Letsholonyane said."We all have our own challenges, but when you're there, people appreciate the effort made to get there and the fact that you want to confront your challenges."I'm treated like I'm part of the bigger family and not like someone who appears on TV. They pray for me, they uplift me and that keeps my feet on the ground." Southgate in from the cold"Yeye" was at his best under Stuart Baxter at Kaizer Chiefs, where the versatile midfielder was at the heart of everything good the club did when they won two league titles and two cup competitions in three seasons.SuperSport are far from being that all-conquering unit but with each match, they are starting to become dangerous contenders.They may match Chiefs' financial muscle, but they are paupers compared to the Naturena side when it comes to stature and following.However, packed stands count for nothing when results aren't being delivered and that is what SuperSport have being doing assiduously.While the 6-1 pummelling of Orlando Pirates and their gutsy penalty shootout win against Mamelodi Sundowns may have drawn attention to Baxter's efficient side, they are still flying under the radar. That's how Letsholonyane wants it to be and feels SuperSport deserve their big club tag."I could have chosen another big team, but I decided to come to SuperSport United," Letsholonyane said. "I've never thought of coming to this club as a downgrade because I wouldn't have come here if that was the case. There are other big teams who think they are big in their opinion, but SuperSport are a big team in their own right.sports@timesmedia.co.za
