ANC structures in Mpumalanga, Gauteng and the Free State this week told the Sunday Times their branches have resolved that long-serving chairmen - David Mabuza (Mpumalanga), Paul Mashatile (Gauteng) and Ace Magashule (Free State) - should step down and contest national elections.Mabuza has been chairman since 2008 and Mashatile was elected in 2007. Magashule is the longest-serving ANC provincial chairman; he has been there since the mid-1990s.Mandla Khoza, the provincial secretary of the ANC in Mpumalanga, said its branches had decided Mabuza should contest for national leadership at the party's elective conference next year.It is understood that Mpumalanga is already campaigning for Mabuza to be elected deputy president under Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, the province's preferred candidate to take over from President Jacob Zuma.The premier league, a powerful ANC lobby led by the premiers of North West, Mpumalanga and the Free State, is earmarking Magashule as national chairman.story_article_left1ANC branches in the Free State have agreed it is time for Magashule to hand over the provincial baton and ascend to national leadership.A Free State leader who spoke on condition of anonymity said there was agreement that this generation of leaders should take the reins at national level."They have been serving for a long time [in their provinces]. It's now their time [to go]," he said.It is unclear for which position Mashatile is being considered because he is not part of the premier league and is known to be their opponent.Mashatile's name has been linked to an informal slate that has Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa as the preferred candidate to succeed Zuma.A discussion about who would succeed Mashatile has begun in the ANC in Gauteng, with one side saying deputy provincial chairman David Makhura is ready to take over as another is pushing for Ekurhuleni mayor Mzwandile Masina.But ANC Gauteng spokesman Nkenke Kekana insisted they had not yet had formal talks."We have not discussed succession yet. Our conference is only in 2018 and the impact of 2017 will be discussed afterwards," he said.This weekend the ANC's national executive committee is expected to open the succession debate and formalise a time frame for branches to start nominating candidates.Until now, the succession debate has focused on who should succeed Zuma, with the race appearing to be between Ramaphosa and Dlamini-Zuma.However, this push to move chairmen to the national sphere has the potential to cause divisions among the so-called united provinces because they may differ on candidates.Mabuza said yesterday he had served his province and completed the work he'd set out to do there. He confirmed he was ready to serve at national level, but said there ought to be a balance of the old and new guard. "You can't go into a process with a hard-and-fixed view. It's a recipe for disaster."
