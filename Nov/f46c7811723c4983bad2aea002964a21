Now a high court judge has finally turned the tide for Martin Blake and a small group of fishermen who are fighting for the right to return to their fishing grounds in one of the country's most beautiful lagoons.By order of court the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries must set aside permit conditions that exclude the fishermen from a large part of the Langebaan lagoon, which has become a flashpoint in a global stand-off over ever scarcer natural resources. Senzeni Zokwana's adviser devised controversial fisheries dealNot only did Blake and his fellow fishermen lose access to their prime fishing ground, they had to watch as rich landowners on the opposite side of the lagoon were allowed to fish there.The irony was hard to swallow: on one shore, struggling coloured fishermen who rely on three weather-beaten boats and a tangle of nets to survive off haarder - redlip mullet; on the other, rich white holidaymakers who fish for sport in the postcard-blue shallows.To add insult to injury, the fishermen were permitted to fish only in the part of the lagoon used by thousands of watersport enthusiasts, fish farmers and the military.Once the custodians of all they surveyed, poor fishermen are now increasingly in daily conflict with those who feel subsistence or commercial fishing is a nuisance."My first boat was lying in the so-called white area when some holidaymakers came and pulled up my anchor and put it in my boat," said Blake. "My boat drifted right out of the mouth. My brother's boat was also lost that way."About 27 Langebaan subsistence fishermen, who qualify for "interim relief" permits because they rely on income from the sea, rotate shifts in three boats. A further six commercial rights holders make up the rest of the fishing rights holders, most of whom live in a former coloured suburb, Langebaan North.Their forefathers lived in four villages around the lagoon and observed age-old turf rights, far removed from government rules and regulations.</img>Kite surfers prepare to take off on the beach at Langebaan lagoon.

Some of them haven't even got food on the table."Langebaan Yacht Club and recreational fishermen declined to comment, and SANParks referred queries to its legal department.Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries spokeswoman Palesa Mokomele said: "We are studying the judgment and its effect and we will engage other departments to determine the way forward. We will thereafter meet the community members."
