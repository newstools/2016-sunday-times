This comes after hopes that a report on labour reforms to be tabled at a meeting of the National Economic Development and Labour Council today would pave the way for measures that could alleviate tension in the labour market.However, Cosatu spokesman Sizwe Pamla said that while Cosatu would be a constructive partner, "most of the things that people want to put on the table to pacify ratings agencies are actually about eroding hard-won workers' rights".He added: "If those ratings agencies can only be pacified through handing over workers to big business, they can forget about co-operation and participation from Cosatu. The issue of the minimum wage is simple: we want R4,500."The ratings issue was a "distraction", he said. " We have lost almost 600,000 jobs this year. No one is talking about how we stop us haemorrhaging jobs." Painful healing lies ahead -- if we're luckyMoody's, which rates South Africa two notches above junk at Baa2 with a negative outlook, will announce its decision on Friday. S&amp;P Global Ratings, which rates it at one notch above junk at BBB- with a negative outlook, and Fitch, which ranks it at BBB- with a stable outlook, will announce their decisions in the next few weeks.Dennis George, general secretary of the Federation of Unions of South Africa, said the labour reforms in the report, including a minimum wage, would be significant in averting a downgrade because they would bring labour-market stability."When we first showed them [the ratings agencies] the draft [report], they were smiling. When I met with them this week, they were quite happy to see that we made our process much more transparent without violating the rights of workers to withhold their labour."Business leaders are hoping that today's Nedlac meeting will have enough substance to swing the ratings decision in South Africa's favour.Goolam Ballim, chief economist at Standard Bank, said that depending on the details, the meeting could "buy us another six months of attempts at structural, political and macroeconomic improvements".What could be announced is the introduction of balloting of workers before strikes are launched, a measure that would be catalytic for creating a calmer labour environment."You have to create an environment that reduces the tendency for strike activity that does not have majority support. You must balance that with underwriting workers' wages. That would be the type of compromise that corporate South Africa would find palatable," Ballim said.It is also hoped that a flurry of meetings that have been held with ratings agencies in the past week will help to avert a downgrade.Goldman Sachs South Africa CEO Colin Coleman, who has been part of efforts to stave off a downgrade by the CEO Initiative and others, said on Friday that the CEO Initiative had made a robust case for maintaining an investment-grade rating. The curveball is they always want that reassurance that institutions will stay intact, and that they will always do what they are supposed to do Members of the CEO Initiative had argued that the economy had "bottomed" in the first quarter when it contracted by 1.2%, as seen in the snapback in the second quarter, when GDP grew 3.3%.Other factors in South Africa's favour, according to the CEO Initiative, are that institutions have proved resilient and that financial markets and corporates perform efficiently in the face of domestic storms.In addition, the government, business and labour were jointly driving structural reforms to facilitate higher rates of growth in the medium term.Stephen Koseff, Investec CEO and co-chair of the subcommittee of the joint business-government working group, said: "It's not a given that we're going to get downgraded. But there's also a chance that they'll say that the political noise we've had over the last while pushes us over the line. Hopefully that isn't the case."Ballim said that in the past year President Jacob Zuma had suffered political blows such as his handling of the Nhlanhla Nene saga, the Constitutional Court's ruling on the public protector's report on Nkandla, the ANC's poor showing in the local government elections, and Thuli Madonsela's swansong report on state capture. SA markets end week on mixed noteThese issues had "heightened society's awareness to keep its gaze on the nuclear deal's progress as the stars have seemingly aligned for its ultimate fruition," said Ballim. "The nuclear deal has the potential to singularly unseat SA's already precarious fiscal balance, and it is elements such as this that will keep ratings agencies unnerved," he added.Ballim said the past year has routinely shown South Africa s institutional fortitude stands resoundingly strong. In this respect, he said, the qualitative portion of the ratings agencies' assessment must give South Africa credit for a cumulatively substantial improvement in the possibility for a more reformist future. Ballim added: "It is items such as these that the ratings agencies will consider in the context of South Africa's institutional fortitude routinely and resoundingly standing strong"Andrew Levy, a labour economist, said the "political hoo-ha" was more material to South Africa's immediate prospects. "Rating agencies are concerned about political stability and corruption. That, I would imagine, are their major criteria right now."He said he expected at least one of the three agencies, and possibly all, to downgrade South Africa. "I believe we'll be lucky if one takes a robust view while the other two are a bit more cautious. Either way, I'm not expecting a reprieve," Levy said.But Lungisa Fuzile, director-general of the National Treasury, who has met with Fitch Ratings and is due to meet with S&amp;P today, said issues of political tension did not surface during talks with Fitch.The agencies "care a lot about fiscal policy issues, will we achieve our growth targets, if we don't what is our plan, if there's a shock what will we do", he said."They place a very high premium on the strength of institutions. The curveball is they always want that reassurance that institutions will stay intact, and that they will always do what they are supposed to do."tsamelad@sundaytimes.co.za; enslins@sundaytimes.co.za; speckmana@sundaytimes.co.za
