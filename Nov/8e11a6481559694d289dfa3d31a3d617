Part of the problem, you could argue, was that he never did quite enough elsewhere to make Chelsea think he should be back at Stamford Bridge competing for a place.Moses was like so many signed by the west London club - an obvious talent deemed surplus to requirements, so sent out on loan to keep his hand in.Antonio Conte, however, saw enough in pre-season to make the Nigeria international part of his plans. And in the first match of this campaign against West Ham, Moses came off the bench to play his first league match for Chelsea in three years. Mourinho is on brink of a meltdownEven then, though, you could never have guessed how things would develop, how he would win a starting place in a side that must now be considered contenders in this title race.Last Sunday's emphatic win at Southampton, Chelsea's fourth on the spin without conceding a goal, proved another ringing endorsement of Conte's five-man defence that has Moses going great guns on the right side.As you would expect of an attack-minded player with this kind of skill, he offers adventurous ideas on the front foot. After scoring against Leicester City a couple of weeks back, Moses could easily have added another one or two here. Fraser Forster twice could not keep hold of well-struck shots.But if that goes with the territory for someone of his type in a team on the up, more impressive still was his defensive work when Southampton pushed on.Quite often, Moses could be found sitting deep in a five-man backline who were more than happy to soak up the pressure.Talking of territory, this is all new, but Moses showed real tenacity and resilience on several occasions to see out the threat on that particular flank.In fairness, it must help to have someone like Cesar Azpilicueta a few metres to his left. As one of the best defenders around, the Spaniard was constantly shouting across to keep his teammate in line. Yaya Tour passesthe peace pipe to PepIf that was not enough, Moses could always rely on his manager to point out failings.Well within shouting distance in the second half, the effervescent Conte would surely have had something to say when Moses failed to stop a cross from Southampton's left-back Ryan Bertrand.That apart, there was not much to criticise.In this wing-back role, you have to be very fit and Moses clearly has the legs and power to shuttle up and down all day.Twenty-six next month, he is still a young man, but also one with less kilometres on the clock than some others of his age.Armed with that asset, the 11-year-old boy who arrived in this country as an orphan has clearly matured over recent years. Anyone under Conte must be able to follow orders to the letter and Moses is showing that ability week after week.A career previously heading in an unknown direction has taken a very surprising and enjoyable turn.
