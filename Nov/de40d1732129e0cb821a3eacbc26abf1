The historic structure forms the heart of a plant nursery run by Cape Town horticulturalist Kate Mason at Montebello Design Centre in Newlands.Now the greenhouse is at the centre of a battle between people like Mason, who view it as a national treasure, and those who wish to see a multipurpose conference centre built in its place.The new structure would "destroy an incredible piece of history and heritage", said Mason.Plans include demolition of most of the greenhouse to make way for a double-volume barn-like structure.The footprint would be 50m bigger and would include an ablution block.Mason said the development would "change the look, feel and nature of Montebello", which was a "rustic haven in the middle of a busy urban setting".It could cost the design centre its visitors, who make an outing of eating at the restaurant, visiting the nursery, chatting to wood carvers, and browsing in arts and crafts workshops.Mason said that even if the battle cost her nursery its tenancy at the design centre, she would count it a victory if the greenhouse was preserved.But Montebello MD Tessa Graaff, who had the plans drawn up, said the proposed development spoke to the "core purpose" of Montebello, which was to "nurture dreams and grow creative solutions from Africa".It was all about "seeding new ideas", she said."We could just keep restoring it, but what is the point of that?" she said. "Kudos to us that we have kept it going, but it is now in a state of danger to the public and is in an imminent state of collapse."</img>The Newlands greenhouse, which was built circa 1902.

A potted history 1764: The Montebello homestead and stables were built. The land belonged to the first brewer in the area, who used spring water. By the turn of the 20th century, Montebello was the residence of the owner of Ohlssons Brewery (today Newlands Brewery) which was on the same estate. Around 1902, the small greenhouse was built. In 1980, former owner Cecil Michaelis bequeathed the property to the University of Cape Town.farbert@sundaytimes.co.za
