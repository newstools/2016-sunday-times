But the gullible National Prosecuting Authority head, Shaun Abrahams, went ahead and told the world that Gordhan, Ivan Pillay and Oupa Magashula were going to be prosecuted over Pillay's early retirement payout.A couple of days before their court appearance this shameless Mampara made a dramatic somersault - disowning his own decision to charge the three. This is what happens when a puppet is appointed to head a critical institution of our democracy.Unfortunately, we are stuck with sheepy Shaun.
