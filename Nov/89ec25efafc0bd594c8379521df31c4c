On receipt of the complaints from Fr Stan Muyebe of the Dominican Order and DA leader Mmusi Maimane on March 18 2016 about allegations of probable impropriety and unethical conduct against President Jacob Zuma and the Gupta family, the president was alerted.On October 2 2016 the president was notified about the investigations, and Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane was notified on October 10, but the report was already prepared, ready and released on October 14.North West ANC backs commission of inquiry into state-capture allegationsIt is known that such a report was prepared by white monopoly capital auditing firm PwC without security vetting at a cost of R3,380 per page. Could it be that that "paragon of virtue", former public protector Thuli Madonsela, seemingly did not follow due supply chain processes?It is only fair to conclude that this report was a reactionary "dossier" formalised as a lawful document in the form of a report.Madonsela did not investigate but merely consolidated this "dossier" based on untested rumour and gossip.Rather, she opted to recommend that the investigations should be conducted by a judicial commission which she just about took the liberty of appointing herself - contrary to the constitutional prescripts she purports to respect.Madonsela has not awarded the Presidency and others affected by her report the opportunity to cross-examine witnesses.She has not given them the opportunity to interact with the evidence or the allegations, and they were denied administrative justice.Their version of events were not necessarily heard in the context of the audi alteram partemrule, without which no court would make any finding. Therefore, the public protector's report is incomplete and flawed.It is based on probabilities and pure speculation. One step forward, two back with Teflon ZumaNo real investigation was done. In fact, investigations are recommended, so we cannot draw any conclusion from the State of Capture report.It is thus malicious for opposition parties to attempt to get the president to step down on the basis of the gossip that characterised the report.Madonsela used to be a member of the ANC. Since Zuma defeated her master, comrade Thabo Mbeki, she has at all times sought to advance factional battles.She was nominated as public protector by Zanele Mbeki, and has served the Mbekis - and her new handlers, white monopoly capital - well, resulting in her being rewarded with a lecturing post at Stellenbosch University.This ties into co-ordinated efforts at regime change which resonate with those who fear losing power after the 2017 ANC national conference.Many of the cadres of the revolution sold out and accepted shares in various white monopoly capital businesses as reward for not pursuing the return of the black Africans' land and wealth.We as black Africans have no freedom in our own land. The blacks in South Africa have, through the ANC, gained 62% of political sovereignty, 3% of economic sovereignty and 5% of security sovereignty. The rest remains in the hands of foreign and national white monopoly capital.Efforts under Zuma's leadership to explore the ocean economy, shale gas and oil, among others, and review mining law to turn the appropriation of mining rights into a prerogative of government, threaten the monopoly of local and international white capital, as do entering the lucrative arms industry in Middle East, the revamp of state-owned enterprises and the support of black industrialists.Those who seek regime change fear Zuma.If you examine big business, some companies side with Sipho Pityana, others with Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, and yet others with Dumisa Ntsebeza. The list is long.ANC will pay a heavy price for sticking with Jacob ZumaThey cannot parade themselves as "messiahs" when they make it difficult for the ANC to take to practical conclusion its good intentions with the second phase of the national democratic revolution.The judicial commission contemplated in the remedial action of Madonsela's report must include all corruption allegations including looting of the new democratic South Africa by apartheid white agents.It should also investigate Madonsela's conduct regarding the leaking of confidential correspondence.Zuma is not an enemy of the black Africans.He is the enemy of those who have sought to undermine our revolution.We are unequivocal and not apologetic at all. He is one of us. We shall defend him.Mmoloki Saviour Cwaile is a provincial executive member of the ANC in North West, writing in his personal capacity
