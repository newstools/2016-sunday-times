Place the flour, salt and warm water in bowl and mix until a dough starts to come together. Add the oil and vinegar. Knead the dough well for 3-4 minutes. Shape the dough into a ball and divide into 40g pieces; you'll need 20 pieces in total. Dust each piece with corn flour. Leave to rest for 10 minutes.2) Using a rolling pin, roll a piece of dough into a circle with a 20cm diameter. Stretch out the dough and keep dusting it with corn flour as you roll; it should ultimately be 0.5mm thick. Cover with a damp cloth and repeat the process with the remaining dough pieces.3) To make the cream cheese filling, mix all the ingredients together and chill until ready to use.4) For the nut filling, mix all the ingredients together.5) To make the syrup, place the sugar, honey, water and lemon juice in a pan. Bring to the boil and boil until the mixture thickens. Remove from the heat and add the rose water and orange blossom water. Set aside to cool.6) Preheat the oven to 180 C. Brush the base of a 20cm round pan with butter.7) Place a circle of phyllo pastry in the prepared pan. Brush it with melted butter and top with another circle of phyllo pastry. Repeat until you have 4 layers of phyllo pastry in total. Sprinkle a fifth of the nut filling on top and bake for 25 minutes. Remove from oven and drizzle the cold syrup over the hot phyllo pastry stack.8) Repeat the process four times; you'll need 5 baked phyllo pastry stacks in total.9) To assemble the cheesecake, transfer the cream cheese filling to a piping bag. Place a baked phyllo pastry stack on a serving plate, nut side up. Pipe some of the cream cheese filling over the nuts. Place another baked phyllo pastry stack on top. 10) Repeat the process until you've used up all the baked phyllo pastry stacks. 11) Press the sliced pistachios onto the sides of the cheesecake, reserving some for garnish.12) Decorate the top layer with the remaining pistachios, dried rose petals and phyllo pastry shards, if using.
