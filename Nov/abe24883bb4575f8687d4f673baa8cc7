"I am happy he broke the record. But I will help him to go one more. That I see as the real record." Rooney out of England squad to meet SpainRooney apologised last week for "inappropriate" pictures of him at a wedding at the national team's hotel during the international break.But later he said the reporting showed "a lack of respect", adding: "It feels as if the media are trying to write my obituary."He was annoyed to be asked about it again after the Feyenoord match, saying: "All that's created by people like yourself asking questions, making a big deal out of nothing."I didn't set foot in the wedding and it's a shame to have to speak about it on nights like this."Ibrahimovic said: "I think when you are famous like that, people are interested. They want to know everything."We should appreciate him for the player he is, what he did. I don't see many players from England who have had the same career as him. They should show more respect for him. Everybody wants to make a little thing a big thing."Manager Jos Mourinho said: "People like him don't need to answer any more, just enjoy a few more years of his career and playing the best he can."
