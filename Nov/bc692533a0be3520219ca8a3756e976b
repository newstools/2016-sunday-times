The new edition of the South African Medical Journal describes two cases that left doctors baffled ... and wincing.In one, a 28-year-old arrived at a Limpopo casualty department in severe pain with a wedding ring constricting his erect penis.In the other, a 20-year-old KwaZulu-Natal man with chest pains was found to have 15 sewing needles inside his heart. Life or death debate may go to parliament Assisted suicide debate may go to parliamentDr Adnane Fhima said the first patient arrived at Van Velden Hospital in Tzaneen reporting that he had put the ring on his penis four hours earlier "for erotic reasons, on the recommendation of friends".After failing to remove the ring with a piece of string and a saw, doctors pricked the penis multiple times to allow blood to escape."The oedema subsided and the ring was successfully removed. Within three days [the patient] had recovered completely and was discharged," said Fhima.Dr Juan Jansen van Vuuren, a medical intern at Edendale Hospital in Pietermaritzburg, said his patient "denied any knowledge of how, or perhaps even why, the needles were lodged within his heart".But doctors found four 1mm scars on the left side of his chest, and the patient told them his intermittent chest pains began around the time he had a psychotic episode in which he experienced hallucinations, delusions and "disorganised speech and behaviour".An echocardiogram revealed the needles, which were moving within the heart's muscle wall with each contraction."The patient required urgent surgery and was discharged within 15 days of hospitalisation," said Jansen van Vuuren.
