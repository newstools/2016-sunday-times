And that goes double for when we travel.Yet, no matter how much technology has changed how we navigate foreign places, there's one area in which tourists still like to kick it old-style: with brochures.Despite online flight bookings and hotel reviews and online travel guides, once they reach their destination, tourists say brochures are their number one resource.This is according to a survey conducted by the Bentley University Centre for Marketing Technology (CMT) in Waltham, Massachusetts, US.Travellers made it clear that even with constant access to online information, they still value printed brochures and take action based on what they read.The findings include: 7 out of 10 tourists and visitors pick up brochures at their travel destination; The influence of brochures from a display stand (69%) has edged ahead of websites (68%) when a tourist arrives at their destination; 95% of visitors had their travel plans influenced by a brochure; 83% plan to visit a business or attraction highlighted in a brochure, map or travel guide; 53% of travellers use brochures to plan their trip before they go.The survey included responses from 1,732 people at 17 locations in North America, Europe and South Africa.
