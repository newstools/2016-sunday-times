But before you write your letter of resignation, take some time to plan your exit so as to minimise the damage to your career.Peter Kriel, general manager of the Independent Institute of Education, a private higher education provider, has this advice: How to find your leader's heart Be certain it is the right time to leave. Make a list of your reasons for wanting to leave your job - this might include " push" factors, such as a dreadful manager or terrible pay, and/or "pull" factors such as an opportunity to join a great company. When compiling your list, remember to include the parts of your job that are working; If, once you have compiled your thorough list, you realise that leaving is the best option, it is still not a good idea to resign immediately. Stay in your position while you investigate other careers and positions that you are interested in pursuing; When you know where you want to go, you can begin plotting your course, making sure you consider the effects of a reduced income or loss of income during the transition; Once you have developed a plan, start taking action immediately. For example, if you are planning to study, ensure you have all the registration details; and Leave your current job with grace and without burning any bridges.
