S nchez suffered what was reported as a "low grade" calf injury during training this week with Chile and has not travelled to Colombia for Thursday's World Cup qualifying match, but Arsenal's information is that the damage is to his hamstring.Wenger is fearful of a repeat of last season, when he made the mistake to play S nchez against Norwich City last November despite his forward complaining of a tight hamstring in the week before the game. THE ROAD TO THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTHThe reports in Chile are of a 9mm tear and, with S nchez receiving treatment in Santiago, Wenger is adamant his own staff should now be given the chance to make their own assessment of the damage."I got a text [to say] that he has a hamstring injury," said Wenger. "The team from Chile has travelled without him and they kept him to try and get him fit to play Uruguay for the second game on Tuesday night."I believe that with a hamstring injury we have to get access for our medical staff to the MRI scan to see what grade it is, how bad it is and make absolutely sure they don't make any suicidal decision that could harm his future for two or three months."That is absolutely important. It's a grey area between the national team and the club team and of course they look at their own results which I can understand but we have to preserve the health of Alexis S nchez."He always wants to play and that's where it is a more sensitive case because he's always ready to play even when injured."Wenger's concerns will hardly have been eased by S nchez's comments yesterday. He said the injury was "hurting a bit" but that he would be "back for Tuesday".S nchez's schedule with Chile has been a constant concern to Wenger, with his player having already accumulated more than 100 international caps by the age of 27. Arsenal are facing an important sequence of matches including a trip to Old Trafford to face Jos Mourinho's Manchester United as well as a Champions League group decider He had not missed a Chile match since March 2013, taking in 50 consecutive games. A statement from the Chile FA said S nchez would remain with their medics ahead of the game against Uruguay.He has also played all 15 of Arsenal's Premier League and Champions League games this season, even after helping Chile win the Copa America during the summer.Arsenal lost S nchez for almost two months in November last season when he suffered a hamstring tear at a time when Wenger was already concerned about his game-load, but he still ended the 2015/16 season having played 58 times for club and country. S nchez has played 50 or more matches in each of the past three seasons.Arsenal are facing an important sequence of matches this month, including a trip to Old Trafford to face Jos Mourinho's Manchester United as well as a Champions League group decider against French Ligue 1 champions Paris Saint-Germain.There are also fears that rightback H ctor Bellerin is facing a significant period out after pulling out of the Spain Under-21 squad on Tuesday.
