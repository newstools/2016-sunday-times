Sungu Sungu Gas confirmed to the Sunday Times that it had put its plans on ice, saying it was "no longer worth it" due to legal challenges by activists, farmers and community leaders.The company had initially applied to prospect for natural gas and oil over 565,000ha in the two provinces, and later applied for an extension of 7,763ha.At a combined 572,763ha, the exploration application by Sungu Sungu Gas was the third biggest in KwaZulu-Natal being considered by the government.In total, applications by Rhino Oil and Gas Exploration South Africa, Sungu Sungu Gas, Motuane Energy and Afro Energy could have resulted in more than 5.9-million hectares of land being explored, mainly for coal-bed methane.In a letter to the Petroleum Agency South Africa this week, Sungu Sungu Gas MD Thabang Khomo wrote that the company's application was being withdrawn "with immediate effect".The Department of Mineral Resources confirmed the application had been withdrawn.Khomo told the Sunday Times the company would reconsider its decision if circumstances and mindsets changed."It's no longer worth it. There are many objections. We decided to just pull out," he said.Frack Free South Africa activist Judy Bell said campaigners were "ecstatic"."It sets a precedent. All the other companies and environmental impact assessment practitioners have to make sure that everything is done correctly," she said."If they don't, they are in trouble."
