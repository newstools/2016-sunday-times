The full bench of the High Court in Pretoria had been set to hear arguments for and against the issuing of the report.

We don t have a problem releasing the report except we need to be sure that all is clear said spokesperson Oupa Segalwe. As you would know there is still the application by (Mineral Resources) Minister Mosebenzi Zwane to consider. We are closely following developments on that as well as the current proceedings in court.
