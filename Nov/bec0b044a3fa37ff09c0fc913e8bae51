It's Lawson's unbridled passion for all things edible that makes her so loveable. Along with a generous dollop of charm, she served up these handy cooking tips during her time on MasterChef.1) Use a teaspoon to peel gingerYou're likely to remove quite a lot of flavourful flesh along with the skin when peeling a piece of ginger with a knife. There'll be less waste if you use a teaspoon to scrape off the skin instead. 2) 'Massage' citrus fruit before juicingSimply roll limes, lemons and oranges against a chopping board with the heel of your hand before juicing them and you'll get more juice out of your fruit.3) Skewer potatoes before bakingPush potatoes onto a metal skewer before popping them in the oven to bake. As the metal heats up it'll cook the potatoes from the inside out, reducing the overall cooking time and helping them cook more evenly.Genius cooking tips we learnt from watching Marco Pierre White on MasterChef4) Marinade meat in a plastic bagRather than using a dish to marinade meat, place it in a sealable plastic bag and add all the marinade ingredients. Not only will there be no dish to wash when you're done, but you won't get your hands dirty when massaging the marinade into the meat.5) Don't 'flood' your roasting tinRoasting marinated meat? Don't tip the meat and marinade into your roasting tin all at once. If there's too much marinade the meat will braise not roast, Lawson pointed out during a MasterChef master class. Instead remove the meat from the marinade with tongs, place it in the tin and then drizzle some of the marinade over the top; you can add some more later on. 6) Use a wooden spoon to safely keep your oven door ajarWhile assisting the Domestic Goddess to make a luscious lemon pavlova, MasterChef judge Matt Preston pointed out a potential safety hazard that goes hand-in-hand with making meringues. Once meringues have baked, you turn the oven off and leave the door open while they cool completely. If you have an undercounter oven, however, you're likely trip over open door. His practical solution? Wedge the handle of a wooden spoon in the door to keep it ajar.
