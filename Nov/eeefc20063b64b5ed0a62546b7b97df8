In a statement the group repudiated in the strongest possible terms both the claims and the unlawful actions of self-styled Prophet Lethebo Rabalago of the Mount Zion General Assembly in Limpopo . Limpopo health boss wants Prophet of Doom to undergo psychiatric evaluation While we believe that the Bible teaches that the Lord Jesus Christ healed people of all manner of diseases and ailments during His earthly ministry He always did so in a way that protected their dignity as human beings made in the image of God. On no occasion did He act in a way that caused physical harm to people or further endangered their health. As such these reported actions are completely contrary to both biblical teaching and practice the group stated. Furthermore spraying a known toxic liquid over another person and thereby causing them physical harm is both unlawful and illegal it added.The group called on the government to exercise its powers to ensure that this action was reported to the appropriate law enforcement authorities, to ensure that its perpetrator was prosecuted to the full extent of the law. We also call upon the victims of these (and similar) acts to withdraw their support from those whose practices and teachings are in no way a reflection of true biblical Christianity.
