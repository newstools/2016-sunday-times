The new restaurant would have been a stone s throw from the city s famous domed Santa Maria del Fiore cathedral, which dates from the 13th century.Trying to maintain its architectural integrity in the face of a proliferation of backpackers and fast-food stores in its historic heart, Florence in January introduced new laws requiring restaurants in the area to use typical products either of the city or from the Tuscany region.The McDonald s proposal even rewrote its rule book, with changes that included having waiters serving customers at tables; sourcing 80% of ingredients locally; and even changing its store design (but still retaining its golden arches).The city fathers, however, were unswayed. We have the right to say no, mayor Dario Nardella said, adding that he wanted to support traditional business in the area and that McDonald s had opened restaurants in several other parts of the city, some a five-minute walk from the Duomo.According to The Guardian, McDonald s said the suit was being filed with the administrative court, which arbitrates in governance disputes in Italy.
