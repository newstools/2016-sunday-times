Jordaan is president of the South African Football Association (Safa). Six years ago he was CEO of the local organising committee when South Africa hosted the World Cup.Jordaan was summoned by a tour operator that alleged that Safa had reneged on a deal to supply it with tickets for the tournament.An events package company, Fli-Afrika, claims it lost R13.9-million after it had entered an agreement with the football body to sell 2,500 tour packages on behalf of the association. The packages included accommodation, tickets and transport to games .Fli-Afrika claims Safa never gave it the tickets and is suing for breach of contract.Jordaan told the court he did not know why he had been subpoenaed. At the time he was CEO of the local organising committee and did not deal with Safa matters."I don't know why I am here. All these documents provided by the court today, I have never seen them until now. I did not sign any of the agreements," he said.Fli-Afrika summoned Jordaan, former Safa CEO Raymond Hack and former president Molefi Oliphant.SAFA reported to have made a R40-million lossFli-Afrika's senior counsel, Pieter Pauw, told the court on Friday that Safa had not submitted any evidence to contradict the claim."Everything is documented, but Safa denies this agreement was ever made."Safa was to pay back Fli-Afrika for any packages that were not sold. The payment was to be made in March 2010, but my client was unable to sell the packages without the tickets."Safa's senior counsel, William Mokhari SC, said Fli-Afrika had to prove there was a breach .Safa regulations permitted only its affiliate, Match, to distribute tickets. The association received tickets only in the first week of June, he said. The tournament kicked off on June 11.Judgment was reserved.Fli-Afrika director Nazeer Camaroodeen told the Sunday Times that his business relationship with Safa began in the 1990s.His company had provided packages for the association for all African and Fifa matches.Other major sporting events that Fli-Afrika had provided packages for were the Olympic Games, Rugby World Cup, Formula One Grand Prix, FA Cup final, Wimbledon and several golf tournaments.Safa's disputes with Fli-Afrika date from 2006 when then 2010 organising committee chairman Irvin Khoza and Jordaan reportedly almost came to blows after Fli-Afrika lost a R100-million Safa travel tender for the 2010 World Cup.Camaroodeen confirmed that he and Khoza were friends and based in the same building in Houghton.
