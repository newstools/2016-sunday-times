It's not every day that a man who has just been appointed minister of finance gets removed from that position four days later.It's also not every day that a sitting cabinet minister gets targeted by the country's top prosecutor - only to have the charges withdrawn just days later.But then Pravin Gordhan - who features in both scenarios - is not your everyday politician.When Des van Rooyen was appointed minister of finance on December 9 2015, causing the rand to tumble, it was the reappointment of Gordhan four days later that lead to the rand staging a recovery.ANC backs off from disciplining Pravin palsSome praised President Jacob Zuma for being a leader guided by public sentiment where the country's financial wellbeing is concerned.But others asked, mutedly: why had Nhlanhla Nene been removed from the position after what many pundits said was an above-average performance at the helm - at a time when many established economies were in free fall?And then, on February 23, the eve of this year's budget speech, the Hawks sent Gordhan a list of 27 questions relating to the South African Revenue Service's "rogue unit".The questions revolved around the legality of the unit in general, but one question specifically referred to Gordhan's authorisation of an early retirement package for Ivan Pillay, the erstwhile head of the unit.Gordhan was so rattled by the timing of the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigations' questions that he said: "Once again, the Hawks, and those who instruct them, have no regard for the economic and social welfare of millions."He responded to the questions on March 30 and in a subsequent interview, said: "I believe this was meant to intimidate and distract us from the work we had to do in preparing the 2016 budget."One of the issues confronting Gordhan following his reappointment was the performance of parastatals, in particular SAA.Gordhan, like Nene before him, was unhappy with SAA's leadership - which set him on a collision course with the airline's chairwoman, Dudu Myeni, a close friend of Zuma.Nene's axing was widely linked to his refusal to authorise some of Myeni's questionable deals.Gordhan also had a stand-off with Zuma over the desirability of retaining Myeni at the helm of SAA. He finally relented in August.It should be recalled that in the same month Gordhan had been threatenedwith a "warning statement" by Major-General MS Ledwaba of the Hawks. It was odd that an experienced lawyer like Abrahams departed from the legal norm that a person charged with a crime cannot be named until they have appeared in court This raised, once again, Gordhan's role in the establishment of the "rogue unit" and his approval, as minister of finance, of Pillay's early retirement and reappointment to SARS in early 2010.Then in October, the vague "warning statement" took concrete form: National Prosecuting Authority head Shaun Abrahams announced that he was bringing fraud charges against Gordhan, with an alternative charge of theft.It was odd that an experienced lawyer like Abrahams departed from the legal norm that a person charged with a crime cannot be named until they have appeared in court - the reason being that they should enjoy the privilege and dignity of anonymity in case the court withdraws the charges immediately.That and the fact that Abrahams had attended a meeting at Luthuli House, the ANC headquarters, the day before making the announcement sparked speculation that Gordhan was being sacrificed at the altar of political expediency.But why? Something wonderful emerges from this terrible timeAh, perhaps it was the small matter of his refusal to intercede on behalf of the Guptas with the four banks that had in April closed the accounts of companies associated with the family after identifying "suspicious" transactions worth R6.8-billion.In what appeared to be an even more dramatic replay of what happened when Nene was removed from his position last year, immediately after Abrahams announced he was going ahead with charges against Gordhan the rand took a tumble.In response, corporate South Africa issued the CEO Initiative Pledge in which business leaders threw their support behind Gordhan in the event that the NPA went ahead with its charges against him. Some ANC leaders joined their ranks.Speaking after a meeting organised by Save South Africa this week, ANC veteran and Corruption Watch chairman Mavuso Msimang said: "They've sat on the ANC and other important bodies just like bags of potatoes and allowed the people to rape the country ... People are actually mugging the constitution to make money and our people in leadership seem to be totally powerless."The meeting was held on the day the courts ordered the release of the comprehensive State of Capture Report.This after Zuma, who fought tooth and nail against its release, finally bowed to public pressure.The 355-page report shows that the SAA leadership and the Guptas are major tributaries of the river in full flood called State Capture.And Gordhan, as captain of the boat we shall call the Protection of State Resources, was being battered left, right and centre by other pirate ships sailing these troubled waters.Captain Gordhan was rather dishevelled at the end of the day but he had averted a shipwreck. It remains to be seen how, having ridden out the storm - if only for now - Captain Gordhan proceeds in what appears to be a quest to rescue state enterprises from the sharks On the day the NPA dropped its charges against Gordhan, the rand strengthened most among 31 major and emerging market currencies against the dollar and climbed 1.7% in October.Then on the day Zuma withdrew his court bid to block the state capture report, the currency surged further, jumping as much as 1.8% against the dollar, the strongest level since September 28."There's relief," said George Glynos, MD and chief economist at ETM Analytics."Across the bond market you've seen a de-risking of that market - simply because the market is going to price in Gordhan's ability now to focus on the job at hand."Which is important if you consider that the ratings agencies will reassess their views soon.It remains to be seen how, having ridden out the storm - if only for now - Captain Gordhan proceeds in what appears to be a quest to rescue state enterprises from the sharks.One also wonders if there's still any trust between him and Zuma, and how this is going affect their working relationship.Ironically, their friendship was once solid, dating back to the '70s in Durban, where Zuma settled after 10 years on Robben Island.What ANC NEC members say about Zuma...Zuma's task was to organise underground structures of the ANC in the region and Gordhan, a firebrand in his 20s, was recruited to assist, also joining the SACP of which Zuma was also a member.In 1981, Gordhan, who had graduated with a degree in pharmacy from the University of Durban-Westville, was fired from King Edward VIII Hospital when his jail time for political activities became a bridge too far for the Natal provincial administration.When the Convention for a Democratic South Africa was constituted, he sat on its first steering committee.Subsequent to that he served on various committees overseeing provincial government and constitutional development - until, in 1998, he was appointed commissioner of SARS.Gordhan and Zuma also sat on committees that sought to restore peace in KwaZulu-Natal after years of fighting between IFP and ANC supporters.Now, as he wipes the salt spray from his brow, one wonders what's next for Gordhan, who has become something of a novelty: a 67-year-old action hero finance minister supported by the corporate world - and the EFF and other lefties - religious leaders, the trade union movement, students and some of his own comrades in the ruling party.And, most importantly, by Joe Public and Tant Betsie who stopped quite a while ago asking the question: Pravin who?
