That was until a handler at a reptile park proposed to his girlfriend while feeding an enormous crocodile.The UK-based Mirror newspaper reported that Australian Billy Collett - fearing rejection but not the 4.5m reptile - got down on one knee and said to the croc ''Stay there and behave", after inviting his girlfriend, Siobhan Oxley, into the enclosure.Collett used a piece of meat to coax the crocodile, named Elvis, out of his pond before asking his girlfriend to "have a crack" at feeding the reptile.Then he dropped a bombshell when he said: ''Three years ago next week, I actually met the girl of my dreams. The girl I love more than anything."Siobhan, I want to spend the rest of my life with you; will you marry me?"He joked that proposing was ''worse than feeding a crocodile".A tearful Siobhan accepted his proposal but said she felt robbed by missing out on feeding the crocodile.Bystanders burst into applause at the Australian Reptile Park, north of Sydney.The park posted a video of the proposal on Facebook yesterday, which has already been viewed more than 100,000 times.
