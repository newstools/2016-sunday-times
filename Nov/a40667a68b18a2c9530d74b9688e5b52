We invited 30 Sunday Times Food readers to the HTA School of Culinary Art in Randburg, Joburg, to act as judges.The puddings were heated according to the manufacturer's instructions and served to the panel of tasters in unmarked dishes without the usual accompaniments of cream, custard or ice-cream so as not to distract from the pudding's flavour.Auditor Stephanie Pardoe was on hand to monitor the process, from removing the packaging and numbering the samples to the preparation and judging. Pardoe collated the scores.Related content First place: WoolworthsJudges' comments: Good flavour and not overly sweet.
