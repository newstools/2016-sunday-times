The Zimbabwean goal ace latched onto a Luvuyo Memela clever pass on the edge of the box and slotted home with his weaker left foot to put the home side ahead in the 22nd minute.Pirates have not won a Premier League game since their 2-1 victory away at struggling Ajax Cape Town on September 13 and this victory is only their third in eight matches so far this season.It was only a first League game for interim coach Augusto Palacios and his second in charge since taking over from Muhsin Ertugral, who resigned in a huff after a humiliating 6-1 hammering at the hands of SuperSport United in their last League match three weeks ago.Palacios has now won back-to-back matches since taking charge after guiding the Buccaneers to the semi final of the Telkom Knockout Cup with a 2-1 triumph over Highlands Park in their last match before the FIFA international break.Despite the win, Pirates remained unmoved on the Premier Soccer League log standings. They are in 6th position with 13 points, four points behind surprise leaders Cape Town City, who enjoyed a brief lead stay at the top following their 2-1 triumph away at Chippa United in the earlier match.For coach Giovanni Solinas, the misery deepened for his Free State Stars charges as they remain winless after eight matches. The only other winless side is Ajax Cape Town, who lost sixth match eight outings after a 2-1 home defeat against Maritzburg United, and it is no surprise to see that both sides prop up the log table in 15th and 16th respectively.Pirates started the match on a high tempo under slightly wet conditions as a result of the rain that poured before kickoff and created more goal scoring chances than their visitors.They deservedly went in front from the boot of the leading goal scorer Ndoro and the lanky striker, who is now four goals clear from his closest rival Jerom Brockie of SuperSport United.Ndoro could have bagged a hat-trick or more had it not been for the brilliance of keeper Thela Ngobeni in the Stars' goal.Memela was devastating for the visiting defence as he cut through them like a hot knife through butter. The gifted winger with an educated left-foot consistently found Ndoro and it was his pass that led to the goal.Despited a late comeback from Stars, who threatened Jackson Mabokgwane's goal on numerous occasions deep in the second half but they just could not get the equaliser.Bucs will have an opportunity to climb from sixth place to fourth, behind third-placed SuperSport United on goal difference and a point ahead of fifth place Kaizer Chiefs, who host Matsatsantsa on Wednesday, if they win away at Chippa in their next match on Tuesday.
