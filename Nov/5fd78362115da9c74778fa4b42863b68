Mayweather told USA Today in New York on Wednesday that he has no need for the money or glory another bout could offer, especially a rematch with 37-year-old Filipino icon Manny Pacquiao, whom he defeated 18 months ago."A lot of fighters in the sport of boxing may want to retire, but they have to fight because they have to," Mayweather said. "I don't have to fight."I just made $300-million for fighting Pacquiao. I'm OK. Like I said before, I'm happy with my position. Once again, the money don't make me. I make money. I'm well off. I make smart moves, and, like I said before, I'm happy with where my career has went."Mayweather, 39, said he attended Pacquaio's victory over Jessie Vargas earlier this month in Las Vegas "at the last minute" to "do something different" with his daughter.Mayweather prompted talk of a Pacquiao rematch by saying the door was "absolutely" open to a comeback after he called it quits in September of last year upon defeating Andre Berto to finish 49-0.Mayweather admits he tosses out differing notions on comeback possibilities depending on how he feels on any given day.
