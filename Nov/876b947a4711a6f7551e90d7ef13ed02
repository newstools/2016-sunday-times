As well as being his new moniker, Stogie T is also the title of his fourth album, released today.Stogie, slang for cigar, reflects the rapper s appreciation for the finer things in life. Something that s evident in the title of the first single from the album, Diamond Walk, which was released earlier this month.Molekane is known as a consciousness lyricist who provides insights into the inheritance of violence from post-apartheid South Africa but he's quick to reassure fans that "my politics have not changed". Instead, he says he's simply "showing another side of Tumi".Stogie T s new album features other artists including AKA and up-and-coming hip hop artist Emtee, which he hopes will help him reach a bigger audience. Music is a conversation with your audience and Emtee is good at that, he says.
