Many of us have goals that we wish to accomplish, yet we are held back by the limitations we place on ourselves. There will always be challenges in life finance, access to markets, sociopolitical issues but the greatest limitation we impose is within ourselves.This was my goal when I took part in the recent Leaders on the Move mentorship experience, sponsored by Johnnie Walker: to understand how to remove these self-imposed limitations and keep making progressive strides.The Johnnie Walker ethos of Keep walking resonated with me as a business and youth leader. Leaders on the Move brought truth to a code I subscribe to: Leaders are turned giants on the shoulders of ordinary civilians. They raise their hands, step out and stand out to make a mark. But how we are meant to do that? Where do we even begin? In a world where he who shouts the loudest is the most heard, what happens to those whose voices could not disturb a leaf?What we need to ask ourselves as leaders on the move, or corporate climbers, is how we start using our abilities to make an indelible mark in any sphere of our operations and in every position we may hold, because that s how we will get noticed and build unshakable organisations.Once we find that ability our reason for existing, the reason we inhale oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide, inhale dreams and exhale triumphs, no matter how small it is it will give us the courage and conviction to keep walking and shrug off our chains.After numerous conversations with CEOs and founders of big South African entities, it is my conviction that talent and intellect that thrive only in the presence of reassuring eyes and a pat on the back do not build societies, communities, organisations and nations.What other path are you left to take when the only obstacle to your greatness and that of this continent is yourself?Remember, don t be afraid keep walking.This article was paid for by Johnnie Walker.
