In a non-human primate study, Rooibos extract achieved "significant glucose-lowering results", scientists say.Professor Christo Muller, chief specialist scientist at the SA Medical Research Council, and researchers from his team and the Agricultural Research Council conducted the latest study in diabetic primates. A tough-love diet could reverse type 2 diabetes: SA studyThey were working with three international research partners with laboratories overseas. The results are due to be published next year and human trials are planned for 2018.Prior research by Muller's team has found that "an aspalathin-enriched extract of green Rooibos effectively lowered raised blood glucose levels in diabetic rats".Aspalathin is a unique compound found only in the Rooibos plant, he said.About one in 14 South Africans suffers from diabetes and 10 years of work on the health properties of Rooibos suggests it may be of value to them.
