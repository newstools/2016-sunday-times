It had been a challenging adventure-motorcycle journey.By the time we got to the Groenfontein and Red Stone Hills junction at Kruisrivier, outside Calitzdorp, our party of three had experienced six minor crashes, run out of petrol and been erroneously chased off a public through-road that crossed over an irate old lady's farm outside Sutherland. Weekend Escape: Sea Shack, Cape ColumbineBut when we arrived at our accommodation in Calitzdorp - the nearly 190-year-old restored homestead that is the Port Wine Guest House - our earlier trials were quickly forgotten.Our first port of call was the vine-covered verandah, where we drank a long, cold beer in relative silence, with only the occasional pleasurable sigh punctuating the stillness.Following a quick stroll through the fragrant gardens, my fianc e Annette and I checked into our comfortable room and, after discovering a welcoming carafe of the town's finest Cape-styled port, soon all we could remember about the enervating trip were the good times: riding through deep Karoo space the previous evening, the edges of the tufted plains tinged with purple and orange bands as we made our way to Matjiesfontein; the meditative ride along the Sinai Desert-like dirt track to Merweville; transiting the spectacular Swartberg Pass and meeting a small busload of Dutch tourists, who picked up on our chorus of "oohs" and "aahs" as we filed the spectacular views into our serotonin reserves for later.In addition to my own movie clip of scenic vignettes, I decided to page through the Karoo chapter of Helen Moffet's Lovely Beyond Any Singing: Landscapes in South African Writing to see if I could flesh out my own experiences further. As I'd just ridden the Swartberg Pass in the late afternoon light, the first verse of Kipling's poem Little Karoo struck me as keenly apposite:Sudden the desert changes,The red glare softens and clings,Till the aching Oudtshoorn rangesStand up like the throne of kings.It was a wrench to have to break our port-tinted reverie but we needed to clean up before heading out to dinner at Zamani's Restaurant.Since it was a balmy spring evening, we decided to walk the "10 minutes" to the restaurant. En route, though, we discovered our fellow-biker, Adam, had aggravated an old hip injury from his earlier fall and it took us a good deal longer to get there than anticipated.Yet it gave us a chance to appreciate the many well-preserved old buildings in historic Queen Street, the old main street of the town. In days gone by, it used to join up with what was called "the road to Little Jerusalem", because of the great number of Jewish residents in Oudtshoorn in those times. The street also used to be lined with poplar trees, but these were destroyed in a violent storm that hit the town in 1930. Lost in time, I thought I heard the rumble and creak of an old Cape cart's wheels behind me Apart from providing shade, a commodity "also as precious as water in the Karoo" (Athol Fugard), they must have presented a grand spectacle as one entered the town.Among the Victorian and Georgian dwellings we passed, I tried to remember from my earlier readings of the "Historical Walking Tour" notes which one had belonged to the wagon-maker; the grocer; the cobbler; the butcher; the baker and the 'Tote', where bookies had taken bets for the Calitzdorp District horse races popular between 1880 and 1885.Lost in time, I thought I heard the rumble and creak of an old Cape cart's wheels behind me but it turned out to be one of the town's late-working gardeners pushing a wheelbarrow across his cobbled driveway.With the smell of lavender, roses and jasmine thick in the balmy night air, it's evident this town is home to numerous enthusiastic gardeners; yet its fecundity is clearly aided by the "leiwater" on offer to many homes here.We enjoyed an excellent meal at Zamanis - I had the most succulent ostrich fillet ever - accompanied by a fine local shiraz.But after a long day of thrills and spills, thoughts of a soft landing on our sumptuous queen-sized bed back at the guest house trumped thoughts of a dessert; most unusual for a couple with ultra-sweet teeth.
