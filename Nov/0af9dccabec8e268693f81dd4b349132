The recent shenanigans and brouhaha surrounding the SABC and SAA have brought to the fore the core issue of cadre deployment by the ANC, a subject that has caused much controversy amid a gross misunderstanding of what cadre deployment truly is and what the policy seeks to achieve.At its 2012 centennial conference, among its many resolutions, the ANC resolved that, "deployment should always be preceded by a systematic academic, ideological and ethical training and political preparation".The ANC has throughout its existence shown commitment to cadre development backed by political education and an academic background, as it pursues its objective of a national democratic society through the national democratic revolution.ANC backs off from disciplining Pravin palsCadre deployment is historically based on the development of a cadreship that is steeped in ideological, academic, political and moral training.Opponents of cadre deployment policies often critique such policies on the basis that they leadto inefficiencies and ineffectiveness because the people who are deployed often betray a lack of competence, academic achievement and bureaucratic skill, but this shows a serious lack of understanding of what a true cadre really is.In Che Guevara's words: "A cadre is an individual who has achieved sufficient political development to be able to interpret the extensive directives emanating from the central power, make them his or hers, and convey them as orientation to the masses, a person who at the same time also perceives the signs manifested by the masses of their own desires and their innermost motivations."A true cadre is an individual of administrative and ideological discipline, someone who is willing to give their life for the purpose of advancing the revolution, a creative leader of high standing, a technocrat with a good political level who places the interests of the masses above personal interests, someone who practises criticism and self-criticism in order to help others and improve collective work.This is what it means to be a true cadre and this is the calibre of person we want to deploy within various sectors of society to achieve our transformational goals and lead the push towards a national democratic society.It is important to highlight these attributes, because one would argue that the reason why we have found ourselves with serious challenges after 1994 is that we haven't truly implemented a genuine cadre deployment policy for the benefit of South African society. The future of the national democratic revolution, and by default South Africa, depends upon it. Let us strengthen our cadre deployment policy... If such a cadre deployment policy were in place, one struggles to see how challenges such as the ones we have faced at the SABC and SAA, as pertinent examples, would ever arise.At this critical moment in the life of our glorious movement it is imperative that we strengthen cadre deployment and defend it as an existential necessity for any revolution which aims to improve the lot of the people.We must remind ourselves, as Joel Netshitenzhe has highlighted in the past, that "the bureaucracy forms a critical part of the state: it is the infrastructure through which policy and technical imperatives find concrete expression. It is not apolitical, as it is meant to carry out the policy mandate of the party that wins elections."Any revolutionary political formation that seeks to transform and advance society must of necessity develop a cadreship that is able to carry out bureaucratic functions with skill, with intelligence, conscientiously and with the utmost levels of revolutionary discipline.So the real issue is not that the ANC has a failed cadre deployment policy; rather it is that the ANC has never truly implemented cadre deployment to its utmost. As a result, we find ourselves with the wrong people, who discredit the organisation and leave it open to criticism and public ridicule.What ANC NEC members say about Zuma...It is time we went back to the basics as an organisation.The people of South Africa are crying out for an ANC of true cadres that will lead them towards nonracialism, nonsexism, unity, prosperity and a better quality of life for all.Indeed, at the self-same 2012 Mangaung conference, we as an organisation resolved as follows: "Believing that the neglect of cadre policy is at the centre of most of the current weaknesses and challenges faced by our movement in the post-'94 era, we reaffirm the perspective that our revolution will only succeed if the movement continuously produces a contingent of cadres who are conscious, competent, committed, disciplined and conscientious."This we must do unapologetically in a systematic, scientific and calculated manner.The future of the national democratic revolution, and by default South Africa, depends upon it. Let us strengthen our cadre deployment policy and unashamedly advance it.Maile is a provincial executive member of the ANC in Gauteng
