The cowboy-turned-gentleman says he caught onto the male grooming craze a few years ago. Though it was tough to get into at first he likes the way his manicured appearance gets him noticed.</img>"When it comes to grooming I m an all-rounder," says Zaakir Randeree (pictured).

On a weekly basis I do visit the barber. Firstly to sort out my beard to keep it in check. Then I sort my hair out for that week. Once that s done every night before I go to bed I oil my beard. When I wake up in my morning I use a cleanser on my beard. [After this] I have to have to sit in front of the mirror and oil my beard. Thereafter I would hair dry it. Monthly I use a beard serum.

I do monthly facials and I do eyebrow waxing. I wax my underarms. That s because I don t like guys that have that crazy hair under their arms. His underarm wax keeps his pits free of dark patches Randeree says. When it comes to grooming I m an all-rounder. I do everything. Whether it be the hair nails body scrub everything. All of that needs to be done. We are guys and not only women need to take care of themselves. Guys need to take care of themselves [too]. - TMG Digital
