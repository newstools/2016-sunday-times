As we reach the end of another week in sport, we hear and read of the challenges so many of our sports teams, coaches, and sportsmen and women have endured. Given the Springboks' woeful end-of-year tour in Europe, some critics are asking: "Where are the sport psychologists in all of this?"We feel little is being said or done about mental preparation and emotional support in sport.Sure, we read about the need for "interventions" and hear commentators saying in passing that mental strength is important, but what is really happening out there? Even the strong need help sometimesInternationally, sport psychologists are an important part of sport. If South Africa is to compete consistently at a high level, sport psychology needs to be an integral part of our sporting culture.So, where are the sport psychologists?We are here, but for a number of reasons only a few of us have the knowledge, skills and qualifications required to be of real service.First, mental skills preparation and development is generally thought to be the domain of sport psychologists, and herein lies the problem.There is no registration category for being a sport psychologist in South Africa. Those who ply their trade in this area of specialisation generally register as psychologists or counsellors and then go on to specialise in sport psychology.There are few of these qualified people around - and even fewer who manage to make a living from practising sport psychology.Second, in South Africa these specific skills are generally located within privileged institutions and areas directed at individual athletes and teams.Athletes and teams with fewer resources at their disposal seldom have access to someone with this level of theory and applied knowledge. Sure, coaches know the basics, but the deeper theory and practice is often lacking.Third, compared to international practice, little is known about this specialised field in South African sport. For South African sport to thrive, sport psychology must be shared with all taking part in sport and physical activity - not just the elite athletes and teams The basics of sport psychology are known, such as focus and concentration, but in-depth knowledge of the complexities of the field is rare.Sport psychology is generally presented within university sports science departments as a module contributing towards a qualification in sports science.Little research and development takes place in psychology departments and in education faculties, the very places which need to contribute to this field.A vital part of solving the problem is the recognition that sport psychology is developmental and ought to start at school and youth level. It can be taken into sports clubs, teams and the lives of everyone taking part in sport and physical activity.By the time many sportsmen and sportswomen get to an advanced stage of sport, sport psychology skills ought to have been developed. These life skills transfers are already required in the current South African curriculum (life orientation) and ought to form an important part of school and extracurricular activities.

Continuous professional development in psychology must be introduced for professionals and teachers involved in sports coaching and physical education.The establishment of an active sport psychologists' association will go a long way in advocating the discipline to all involved in sport and physical education. Parents need to be educated about their role in supporting their children in coping when setbacks and injuries in sport occur.Sport psychologists ought to be an integral part of any team or athlete's progress and their tenure cannot be dependent on immediate success.Building a professional relationship with a team or athlete takes time. Sport psychologists need to be there in the good times and the bad. The regular hiring and firing of coaches and support staff is evidence that South Africans far too often focus on a season instead of long-term goals.For South African sport to thrive, sport psychology must be shared with all taking part in sport and physical activity - not just the elite athletes and teams.
