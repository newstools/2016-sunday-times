And the bromance didn t stop there. I m sleeping with him tonight Du Plessis said as he hugged Rabada at the post-match press conference.Rabada stepped into the breach left by Dale Steyn who broke his shoulder while bowling on Friday and earned himself an enforced break of around six months.Just 21 Rabada shouldered more than his fair share of the burden bowling 31 overs for his second-innings haul of 5/92. KG just wanted the ball Du Plessis said. Everytime I asked him if he was tired if he was done he said No. You re not taking the ball out of my hand . That s a sign of a champion bowler for me. He wants to be in the fight the whole time. Du Plessis was happy with the performance of a team who were dismissed for 242 in their first innings and then allowed the Australians to reach 158 without loss at stumps on the second day.The next day South Africa claimed all 10 wickets for 86 runs.Then Dean Elgar and JP Duminy scored centuries and shared a partnership of 250 to enable South Africa to set the home side a towering target of 539.They were dismissed for 361 and South Africa won by 177 runs.It was Australia s first loss in their opening home test of the summer since 1988 and their fourth consecutive test defeat. In my career that s one of the most special days Du Plessis said. To turn it around 360 degrees from day one where we were under the pump and under a lot of pressure to turn it around on day two was one of the best days of cricket I ve been involved in. South Africa will hope to keep the heat on the Australians when the series resumes in Hobart on Saturday. - TMG Digital
