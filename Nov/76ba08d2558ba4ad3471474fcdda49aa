Sunday Times has learnt that Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane, former Ajax Cape Town mentor Roger de Sa and Cape Town City's Eric Tinkler are all strong contenders to take over one of the toughest but most lucrative seats in South African sport.The suspended Mashaba is set to be fired this week after appearing before the South African Football Association's (Safa) disciplinary committee.The next Bafana coach is almost certain to also be a South African and he will be required to hit the ground running. The story of a coach who dug his own graveHe must have a deep well of continental football experience, and must also be equipped with an intimate understanding of South African football, its players and its politics.None of the above conditions are negotiable.Mosimane's African Champions League triumph with Sundowns last month, his previous experience as Bafana coach, his travels on the continent with SuperSport United, his two Premier Soccer League titles and his many other domestic titles put him very much in the driver's seat.Sundowns owner Patrice Motsepe has a very close relationship with the Safa leadership and Sunday Times understands that he would not stand in Mosimane's way if Safa House makes an approach for his coach's services in the coming days.De Sa's run to the final of the 2013 African Champions League with Orlando Pirates - where they lost 3-1 on aggregate to Egyptians Al Ahly - has been noted by Safa, and his experience both at home and on the continent also puts him in the frame.Tinkler's run to the final of the 2015 Caf Confederations Cup with the selfsame Pirates - the Bucs lost 2-1 on aggregate to Tunisia side Etoile du Sahel - will not hurt his own chances either.But BidVest Wits coach Gavin Hunt is not likely to make the cut as his club has often taken a lacklustre approach to continental competitions.Hunt's decision to field weakened lineups in Caf competitions and preferring to prioritise domestic commitments in the past will now come back to haunt him.</img> Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane.
