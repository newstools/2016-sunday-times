No one spoke about her "missing" aunt - other than to say she was "bewitched". Her family were hiding her in her bedroom and then two years later she died.She had HIV.This stigma inspires Raborife to be involved in an HIV vaccine trial taking place in South Africa. She is a member of the community advisory board at the Setshcaba Community Clinic in Soshanguve. Raborife spoke at the media conference launching the trial on Wednesday about her role. SA trial could lead to licensing of world's first HIV vaccineThe clinic is one of 15 sites across the country in which volunteers are being recruited to take part in the vaccine trial that will inject 5 400 men and women with either the vaccine or a placebo comprising sterilised water. Members of the community are educated how the trial works and what benefit the clinic plays in the community and anyone can visit the clinic to see it.The community board of which Raborife is a part will oversee the trial and meet with participants over the three years that the trial runs to ensure no one involved is unhappy or confused. "When Pretoria was burning a few months ago and clinics burnt this site wasn t burnt." said Raborife at Wednesday's launch of the vaccine trial.Unhappiness with the ANC mayoral candidate had led to rioting and burning in the community.Raborife said: "Because of relationship [this clinic site staff has ] with the community has this was not damaged is otherwise you wouldn't have been here today."The role of a board is to educate the community and to ensure the participants are happy with the way the trials are conducted.All those taking part in the trial at 15 sites around the country are aged 18 - 35 and must be HIV negative.Men are encouraged to be circumcised which reduces the risk of HIV by 66% and offered use of antiretrovirals as prevention.Women are also offered preventative therapy - taking a pill a day of a certain ARV can reduce risk of contracting it by about 60%.All participants are given condoms and lubricant and regular HIV testing.Half will receive the vaccine the other half a placebo - which contains sterilised water.Researchers do not know who is getting the real product or the fake vaccine and only see the results when the trial is complete. Participants receive five jabs in a year and will be followed for three years. It is hoped if the vaccine can reduce the risk of contracting HIV by 50- 60% even for a few years that it can be given to high risk individuals such as adolescents in KwaZulu-Natal.Scientists say they have to find a way to prevent HIV as an estimated 1 000 people get HIV a day in South Africa.- TMG Digital/The Times
