Q: For the first time in my adult life, I am not in a relationship. Is it healthy for a woman to go without sex for long periods?A: The simple answer is yes; all people can be celibate for as long as they wish. There are many reasons people may not be having frequent sex.Some people abstain from sex for religious reasons, or as part of relationship or pre-marital counselling; some couples decide to not have sex for an agreed period of time.Some people have made the decision while on a spiritual journey.Sex Talk: Does a lack of orgasms still make for a happy sex life? Often, people can suffer emotional and psychological stress if, without voluntarily choosing to be celibate, they find themselves in a relationship that is no longer meeting their needs or expectations of physical intimacy and sex.Pleasurable things like masturbation or self-pleasure with toys may not be considered "having sex" as there is no one else involved.You may find that someone who regards themself as not having sex is still enjoying sexual self-pleasure.There are medical conditions that may affect one's desire for sex, as well some commonly prescribed medications that may affect factors like arousal, lubrication and ejaculation, and sometimes the ability to orgasm.If you find that you are having an unfulfilled sex life it is advisable to see your doctor for a medical check-up and possibly have blood screening tests to ensure that you do not have any medical issues that can be managed.
