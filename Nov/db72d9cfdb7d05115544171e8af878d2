President Zuma and his deputy, Cyril Ramaphosa, flew to Cape Town after a text message was circulated claiming that 100 ANC MPs had been lobbied by opposition parties to vote in favour of the DA's motion of no confidence in Zuma.So shaken was the ANC leadership by the SMS that it convened a political committee meeting ahead of its caucus gathering on Thursday - to give political guidance to its MPs before the vote on the motion. So where were you when crunch vote was held?ANC insiders say deputy secretary-general Jessie Duarte addressed the caucus on Thursday morning, speaking extensively about the SMS and calling on the party's MPs to remain loyal and not be swayed by the opposition."The leadership is panicking all over. The deputy secretary-general did raise the issue of all these attempts that are being made to persuade some of us to vote for the motions," said an MP who asked to remain anonymous."I personally did not receive an SMS, but I did get e-mails from all sorts of people, including from the DA and some purporting to be from ANC structures, saying I should consider voting in favour of the motion."Three other MPs said former Limpopo premier Cassel Mathale had told the meeting there were people within the party who were spreading rumours that he had been paid R20,000 to vote for the motion."Cassel felt that people were abusing his proximity to Julius Malema and he made it clear it's wrong to use this to cast aspersions on his integrity or loyalty to the party," said one MP.Mathale and Duarte could not be reached for comment at the time of going to print.ANC caucus spokesman Moloto Mothapo said caucus discussions were confidential.
