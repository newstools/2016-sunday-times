Launching a new initiative called Airbnb Trips, chief executive Brian Chesky said the company wanted to put the magic back into travel."For many people travel is basically a research project," he said at the company's annual Airbnb Open conference in Los Angeles on November 17. "You can spend as much time planning your trip as on your trip. We want to fix this."5 of South Africa's most quirky & stylish Airbnb getawaysWith the new Airbnb Trips app, travellers will be able to have single experiences lasting from a couple of hours to immersive trips lasting three days, ranging from guided off-road motorbike trips to surfing lessons from a pro surfer.The new app will also allow Airbnb hosts a new way of making money beyond merely providing travellers a place to stay, Chesky said.Users will be able to filter by categories such as food or adventure, and use a timeline feature under the Trips tab, which will let the company spot the gaps in your itinerary and suggest other activities to fill those unplanned hours.The Trips app will expand Airbnb's already considerable footprint in travel as it seeks to be than just an accommodation provider.Airbnb Trips are now available in 12 cities including Los Angeles, Paris, Nairobi, Tokyo and Cape Town.
