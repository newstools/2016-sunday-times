But new advice published in the Lancet Psychiatry suggests that parents could be doing more harm than good by lying about Santa Claus.According to psychologist Christopher Boyle, of the University of Exeter, UK, and mental health researcher Kathy McKay, of the University of New England, Australia, lying to children about Saint Nick can undermine the trust in the parent-child relationship, with the pair commenting in their article that, "If they are capable of lying about something so special and magical, can they be relied upon to continue as the guardians of wisdom and truth?""All children will eventually find out they've been consistently lied to for years, and this might make them wonder what other lies they've been told," they added.
