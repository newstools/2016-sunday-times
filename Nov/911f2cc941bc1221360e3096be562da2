Normally the implosion is saved until the manager's third season at a club, but after Thursday night's rant at his own players following the 2-1 defeat at Fenerbahce, Mourinho appears to be in full meltdown mode already.Here are the tell-tale signs that things are already falling apart for Mourinho.Turns on one of his own playersIker Casillas, Juan Mata, Pepe - there's a long list of players who Mourinho has rebuked in public, and it did not take him long to round on his team this season. After only the fifth match of his reign at United, Mourinho was already criticising, in public, some of his players, having pointedly taken off Jesse Lingard and Henrikh Mkhitaryan at half time in the 2-1 defeat to Manchester City.In his post-match interview, Mourinho said: "I'm clearly disappointed with the first half. Disappointed with some really poor individual performances that affected the level of the team."We didn't have a tactical problem, we had problems with poor performances, we lost the ball very, very easy. Even now our central defenders today they lost easy balls, bad passes, first station passes from [Eric] Bailly to [Marouane] Fellaini and [Daley] Blind to Paul Pogba."I made a couple of decisions that I thought individual qualities of certain players would give me what I know that I want and I didn't get it."A week later and Mourinho was at it again, chastising Luke Shaw's defending in the 3-1 defeat at Watford."I knew I had a task. But the first Man City goal and this second goal, you can find incredible similarity," he said."[Aleksandar] Kolarov has the ball in a difficult situation in the corner and my player instead of going up and pressing decides to give him space."Today for the second goal, [Nordin] Amrabat on the right side, our left back is 25m distance from him, instead of 5m."It emerged after the match at Vicarage Road that Shaw was suffering with a groin problem, and reportedly some of his teammates confronted Mourinho about what they felt was unfair criticism of the defender, whose career has been littered with injury problems.Offers expert medical opinionThe confrontation with Dr Eva Carneiro over her treatment of an injured Eden Hazard last season was one of the most undignified moments of Mourinho's reign at Chelsea. Mourinho also has previous history with falling out with medical staff, dating back to 2006 when he claimed Petr Cech had to wait 30 minutes for an ambulance after being knocked out by Stephen Hunt.The ambulance service responded by saying his version of events contained "serious factual inaccuracies".Then last year, Mourinho's decision to keep Oscar on the pitch against Arsenal after he had suffered concussion was branded "completely unacceptable" by the FA concussion panel.This season Mourinho reacted tetchily when it was put to him that Anthony Martial had suffered concussion against Watford. He played on for eight minutes despite looking dazed, and was ruled out of the next match against Leicester City."Martial is not available," Mourinho said tersely. "He is out because of the contusion in the calf and ankle area. I think you know when that happened."Falls out with refereesMourinho has launched some explosive tirades at referees before - not least at Jon Moss at Upton Park last season, which earned him a stadium ban.He was at it once more against Burnley at home last Saturday when he angrily confronted Mark Clattenburg during the interval.Mourinho was promptly given a one-game touchline ban and 50000 fine after accepting two FA misconduct charges.Finds issue with opposition managerMourinho has feuded with fellow coaches throughout his career, but his dispute with Antonio Conte last month suggested this was a man on the edge.Having just seen his team beaten 4-0 by Chelsea, Mourinho took umbrage at Conte trying to rouse the Stamford Bridge crowd and whispered his discontent into the Italian's ear at the end of the match.Mourinho refused to divulge what was said at the end of the match, but it spoke of a man desperately looking for something to distract from his team's abject performance. Yaya Tour passesthe peace pipe to PepPersonal problemsPerhaps the most surefire sign of Mourinho's meltdown this season has been the bizarre interview he gave with Sky Sports last month when he claimed his life in Manchester was "a disaster".Discussing his life as a resident at the Lowry Hotel in Salford, Mourinho said: "You know the history of the paparazzi, for the hotel and the brand that sponsors me, the clothes brand, [it] is amazing because they are there every day."Lays into the whole teamThe aftermath of Thursday's defeat at Fenerbahce carried eerie echoes of his last match in charge of Chelsea, when he accused the team of not carrying out his orders in the 2-1 defeat at Leicester City.On that night Mourinho claimed his players had "betrayed his work", while on Thursday he said: "I passed all my experience to the players."We are fragile, I know we are. We have to be stronger mentally and start the game better than we did."What's next?There hasn't been a public referee rant as yet and Mourinho is still to question the board for not making the signings he wanted. A few more bad results though and they can't be far away.
