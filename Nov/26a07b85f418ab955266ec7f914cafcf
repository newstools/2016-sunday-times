But is there good to this rise, does it bring us closer to a place of renewal? One of democracy's side effects is that it from time to time gives birth to populism - and to demagogues like Donald Trump.But the rise of a Trump can't be any good for anyone on the planet, you might say.Yet perhaps there's a positive aspect to the emergence of a Trump, Boris Johnson or a Julius Malema.The populist backlash "serves a useful purpose because it reminds the elite - who dominate our politics and the economy - that they have screwed up in the last decade in multiple ways. People have a right to be angry," British economic historian Niall Ferguson told Business Times this week. Trump win will be a 'populist crisis'It's to wake the elite from the comfort of their slumber. And if those across the Atlantic aren't awake to the risks as they head to polls on Tuesday, they never will be.Britain's decision to exit the EU should serve as a reminder that you ignore the marketers of snake oil at your peril.Among the desperate and downtrodden, there are always buyers.Should Trump get into the White House after Tuesday, the age of populism could threaten geo-political security. The poll is a watershed moment in this surge of populism.South Africa's watershed moment in the rise of populism may have come this week when President Jacob Zuma withdrew his application to interdict the release of the public protector's report on state capture.Zuma rose to power in the ANC, which has historically held the middle ground, on a rather populist ticket.It was a ticket that said business and the class project of his predecessor had ruined everything and only a state-led economy could save South Africa from the ravages of a financial sector crash and plunging commodity prices.The past decade has proved he isn't really a believer in leftist policies or, in fact, in any ideological argument, but a populist he remains.And this past week has been one of reckoning. I'd like to say final, but we all know better. Nevertheless, it had the hallmarks of a watershed moment.What Zuma promised to the 4000-strong ANC branch members who elected him party leader at two conferences has not been delivered. Or Trump will be US president and Britain will file for divorce from Europe, its most important trading partner Alliance partner Cosatu's biggest member has called for his resignation and the ANC under his presidency is fast losing credibility in the eyes of the electorate.There can be no escaping that the parade that once followed the populist that is - or rather was - Zuma no longer comes with confetti sprays.His race is run and the party appears to be trying to finds its centre again, waging a struggle within.Meanwhile, the popularity of Malema and his EFF will continue to rise. SA not alone as we plunge into absurdityPopulist by nature, Malema, however, serves as a reminder of the ANC's failure to visibly transform the economy and effectively deal with rising inequality.The merits of the EFF's proposed solutions, at this juncture anyway, are not really important.What is important is that there is a stage for the frustrations of a mainly black and young populace.The business and political elite must take heed of what Malema is selling to his followers.There's a mutual and beneficial struggle in South Africa's body politic: the removal of a president.Should it come to pass, the age of populism is far from being over, especially if the economy doesn't find its feet.There's value in the expression of populist anger, and it is for the business and political elite to act.Or Trump will be US president and Britain will file for divorce from Europe, its most important trading partner.E-mail derbyr@sundaytimes.co.za or find him on Twitter @ronderby
