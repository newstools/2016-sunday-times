"I thought, how hard could a bed be? It has wheels, a base, a mattress."That was three years ago, but his prototype children's hospital bed has consumed much of his life since then.Last year Aylmer quit his job at a cosmetics counter after he approached the Nelson Mandela Children's Hospital Trust. He has spent the past 18 months raising capital, working with engineers to upgrade his student project, sourcing parts and learning about European hospital product standards - all while, in typical entrepreneur start-up style, working in his mom's kitchen.His clear plastic bed, softer and warmer to touch than cold steel cots, meets European hospital bed safety standards. Madiba's dream for sick kids comes true Johannesburg is set to get the country's second hospital dedicated exclusively to childrenSeveral paediatricians and members of the trust have worked with him on the prototype, and 50 beds have been ordered for the Nelson Mandela Children's Hospital.Aylmer, 27, said the problem with being a sick toddler in hospital is that you "get stuck in a cage".Standard hospital cots have high steel bars to ensure young children can't topple out and the cold, hard steel ensures the cot is cheap and easy to clean in automated washing rooms."Doctors say they need a prison [to restrain a child] but it must be a nice prison."The trust's staff have nicknamed Aylmer's clear plastic colourful bed "Jed's Bed", although the official name is Symba.All four sides come down - in contrast to standard cots which only have two sides that can be dropped. The wall at the head of the cot can be lowered, making it easier for doctors to reach a child's head or neck for a medical procedure.Eight attachment ports -- two on each bed corner - allow oxygen tanks, drips and medical devices to be safely attached. This means only one nurse is needed to push the bed around.Paediatrician Keith Bolton said it was not usually the job of a specialised academic hospital to aid bed makers, but the hospital also wanted to grow local businesses.Aylmer believes parents will look at the bed and think: "My child will get better in this."
