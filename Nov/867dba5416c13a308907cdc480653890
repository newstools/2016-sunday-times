The process to procure the aircraft started last month and was discussed at a provincial cabinet meeting on October 26.The Sunday Times has seen a memo from Mahumapelo's office, sent to NorthWest Transport Investments, which is owned by the provincial government.It invited the company's board to the meeting to make a presentation on the "procurement of a state aircraft".Mahumapelo's office has confirmed the plans to buy a jet and rejected suggestions that the move was a waste of money. Battle over Zuma and Ramaphosa VIP convoys 'one of expense'The plans emerged at a time when the National Treasury has introduced austerity measures amid declining revenues. Although no price has been attached to Mahumapelo's dream jet, to buy and operate the aircraft could cost the provincial government millions.Provincial government spokesman Brian Setswambung said the provincial cabinet decided last month to ask its public transport entity "to do a cost analysis" on what was more effective: subsiding the Mahikeng airport route, or buying a jet."The outcome of that cost analysis is not yet known because it has just been assigned, so no decision can be taken before government knows what would work and what would not."As a government that is mindful of the challenging economic climate and the need for more resources to service our people, any decision that would be taken will consider our primary mandate, which is to ensure that we deliver services effectively ... if the government of Bokone Bophirima [North West] ever owned an aircraft ... that aircraft would be for use by all members of the exco to enable them to perform their duties with the necessary speed," said Setswambung.But government insiders say Mahumapelo wants to use the jet to fly across the country and abroad. They say it is unprecedented for a provincial cabinet to buy its own aircraft because this was the domain of the Defence Department through the air force.North West is one of South Africa' s poorest provinces , with economic activity limited mainly to mining towns like Rustenburg. It has an unemployment rate of 43%, and an annual budget of R36-billion. We are also not surprised by his latest behaviour as he also wanted the same security arrangements like that of the president of the republic Setswambung said the North West government had spent R84-million subsiding the Mahikeng airport route and was expecting to spend another R100-million between this year and 2017 in its contract with SA Express.SA Express flies only three times a week between Mahikeng and Johannesburg. There are no direct flights to other national centres.Phatudi Maponya, chairman of NorthWest Transport Investments, said the jet was intended to solve government travel delays caused by using SA Express."No ways is it a plane for the premier. That person that gave you that information was malicious; the premier still even uses an old car."He [Mahumapelo] never said he wants to buy an aircraft for himself," said Maponya. Plans for new presidential jet put into holding pattern after tender cancelled"There is an airline flying between OR Tambo and North West and there are so many delays."The explanation by SA Express is that they don't have enough aircraft. They are two hours late, or three hours, all the time."These guys [SA Express] are thinking of adding additional flights; it is unreliable."The state is not going to buy an aircraft. SA Express needs a subsidy from North West, that is what they proposed," he said.The EFF, the official opposition in North West, slammed the aircraft plan."The EFF condemns the plan to purchase a private jet for the North West premier."We've been consistent in our call for this man to resign, or for the ANC to fire him before he does further damage to the fiscus of North West," said Alfred Motsi, EFF leader in the North West legislature."We are also not surprised by his latest behaviour as he also wanted the same security arrangements like that of the president of the republic."He thinks he's special and above all [provincial] premiers."The EFF will never allow him to buy a special jet for himself [using public funds]," said Motsi.
