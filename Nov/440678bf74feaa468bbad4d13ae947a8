It was the first-class captain Ramela who lodged the initial complaint at the end of last season while the most experienced player on the Cobras books and limited-overs captain, Ontong, finds himself defending his embattled coach.With the side having lost two first-class matches by an innings and one by 175 runs, it was clear the ground beneath the team was far from firm.This is something Ontong is aware of but said he was firmly in Adams' corner even though the franchise was clearly malfunctioning on the field because of the disharmony off it.He said: "I understand it's a very tough job to be a coach and it's not all the time where you can leave your coaching job and say it's enough. Proteas pair continue their love affair with the Waca"There will be tough periods one has to deal with and Paul is doing so very well. I'm 100% behind him and I know there are some players who have some grievances."The terseness in Ramela's voice was indicative of a principled player who felt he did the right thing, especially when he referred the tough questions to SA Cricketer's Association (Saca) chairman Tony Irish.While it is clear there are two camps within the franchise, Ramela chose to be diplomatic. "We have to get on with business and we have got a job to do. I know some of the players have tried to do their work and that's the one fundamental I can talk about."There isn't a clear split where the players are taking sides in terms of who is on the coach's side and who isn't. As players we get on quite well because we know what we're there to do."We haven't played well this season and that's the bottom line. You may look at other things but that's the nitty-gritty the results are displaying."The inability of the franchise and Western Cape Cricket (WCC) to take the bull by the horns has seen Saca step in with the possibility of an imminent players' strike after WCC refused to accept a Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration resolution to appoint an independent assessor to look into Adams' readiness for the job.There was an early independent assessment conducted by the experienced Paddy Upton that suggested that Adams should step aside, but the WCC board flat-batted that suggestion, citing material deficiencies in his report.Irish was loath to say whether the team was split in two because of the WCC board's pig-headedness, but said they did not seem like they wanted to find a resolution.The fact that a new panel has been convened with Boland Cricket Board president and WCC chairman of playing affairs, Angelo Carolissen, at the helm alongside Ramela, Adams, Ontong and assistant coach Ashwell Prince points to a plaster being applied on a festering wound. SPITTING COBRAS"The fact convenor of selectors Alan Dawson resigned because of the fundamental breakdown between the players and the coach that made his job impossible points to how the franchise has buried its head in the sand," Irish said."The franchise needs to understand there is a problem and at the moment, they are acting like there's no problem and they're carrying on with life as normal."The first step to finding a solution is acknowledging that there's a problem."The majority of the players are part of this grievance but there are a couple of young players who aren't part of the issue because they haven't been there long enough to be part of the decision-making.I don't want to talk about who is on which side but the majority of the contracted players are part of the grievance and most of them are senior players."Irish said the industrial action would be the last resort of Cricket SA, if Saca and the WCC do not find a resolution.With the local Twenty20 competition starting on Saturday, an embarrassing situation for the franchise may yet be beamed out, especially with the majority of the games being televised.
