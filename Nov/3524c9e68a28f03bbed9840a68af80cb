If their previous designer collaboration with Balmain is anything to go by, it's sure to cause a fashion frenzy with pieces selling out before the day's end.If you buy just one thing from this collection, here's what each of the Sunday Times fashion team recommends you pick: I am obsessed with the silk pyjama set (patterned silk blouse, R899 and pants, R1,099) that Elizabeth Olsen wore to the KENZO x H&amp;M launch in New York. Perfect for laid back pyjama dressing, or paired with a skyscraper heel for a night out. Sharon Becker, Fashion Director The KENZO x H&M collection has hit SA. Here's what to expect I love a good graphic t-shirt and nothing makes more of a subtle statement than the KENZO x H&amp;M white tee with the tiger motif ((R429). This summer I will be rocking it on the streets with a pair of 'mom' jeans and a nice fitted jacket. Ntombenhle Shezi, Fashion and Beauty Writer These reversible silk-blend trousers (R2,299) are my must have . They are timeless and stylish, perfect outfit for the fast-approaching festive season. Khomotso Moloto, Fashion Assistant 5 minutes with H&M's creative advisor Ann-Sofie Johansson My favourite piece from the collection is this reversible silk kimono (R2,999). I am particularly crazy about the accentuated sleeves and boxy silhouette. The pops of floral print are and added bonus. Ranaa Patel, Fashion Intern
