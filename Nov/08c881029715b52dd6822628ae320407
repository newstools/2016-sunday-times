Researchers from Cornell University have found that people are more grateful, and even more generous, when they enjoy experiences rather than material gifts.Previous findings have already shown that feeling gratitude can lead to many positive health benefits, including increased feelings of happiness, better health outcomes, improved sleep quality, and even improved social cohesion.The new research from Cornell has now also found that we feel more gratitude for experiences than for what we own - and this gratitude results in more generous behavior toward others.

You might say, 'this new couch is cool,' but you're less likely to say 'I'm so grateful for that set of shelves.' "Think about how you feel when you come home from buying something new," explains Thomas Gilovich, professor of psychology at Cornell University and co-author of the study, "You might say, 'this new couch is cool,' but you're less likely to say 'I'm so grateful for that set of shelves.' But when you come home from a vacation, you are likely to say, 'I feel so blessed I got to go.' People say positive things about the stuff they bought, but they don't usually express gratitude for it - or they don't express it as often as they do for their experiences." 'Envious' is the most popular personality type, scientists sayGilovich also believes that governments could use the findings, published online in the journal Emotion, to improve well-being of citizens and improve society. "If public policy encouraged people to consume experiences rather than spending money on things, it would increase their gratitude and happiness and make them more generous as well," he commented, with the team concluding that, "shifting spending toward experiential consumption can improve people's everyday lives as well as the lives of those around them." Previous research has also looked into what type of spending makes us happier, with a Canadian study published last year finding that maybe money and material possessions could bring happiness.The research found that both material and experiential purchases gave spenders happiness, but material purchases brought repeated feelings of happiness over time, while experiences brought a more intense, but shorter feeling of happiness.However, that study also found that when participants looked back on their purchases six weeks after Christmas, experiences gave them more satisfaction.
