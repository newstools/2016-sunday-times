And should agreement over eligibility not be reached, the matter could go to arbitration which could force the postponement of the poll.The disqualifications, which included two incumbent board members, arose from an interpretation of the Sascoc constitution allowing only representatives of national federations to stand.Kobus Marais of the SA Sports Association for the Physically Disabled and Jerry Segwaba of the Free State Sports Confederation were among 11 candidates ruled ineligible, apparently because their organisations are not federations."The meeting is convened to deal with the unhappiness with the nomination process," president Gideon Sam said on Friday.A senior counsel who confirmed the new interpretation would brief the executive, he added."The board will deliberate [on] whether the interpretation stands or whether the unhappy candidates should be allowed to go for arbitration which, of course, can impact on the date set for the election."Sascoc CEO Tubby Reddy dismissed as "utter nonsense" suggestions that the timing of the disqualifications - so soon before the elections - was malicious."As the CEO, I have the power to delegate the assessment of nominations, thus ensuring that my office is not in any way involved in determining who is or is not eligible."Asked why the two incumbents had not been disqualified from standing in previous polls, Reddy replied:"[That] may be as a result of the previous scrutinisers not having picked up the strict definition of article 12.8."
