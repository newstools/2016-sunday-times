After President Jacob Zuma, he is the most- watched man in the country. Gordhan describes himself as a man of optimism and hope; many see him as a man of integrity and honour.This is his second stint as finance minister, having first served from 2009 to 2014. Then, late last year, he was brought in to restore calm and re-establish credibility after the disastrous four-day stint of Des van Rooyen that followed the sacking of Nhlanhla Nene.Some believe Gordhan is all that keeps South Africa from junk status because he has the credibility and gravitas to provide ratings agencies with assurances that their concerns are at least being heard.Large parts of civil society and many leaders in the ANC have come out in Gordhan's defence in the face of legal manoeuvring against him. Business Times Top 100 Companies 2016Top business leaders have taken the unprecedented step of forming an initiative in support of the minister.The fact that this award - which has always celebrated business people - goes to a government minister this year suggests just how important the body politic is right now."Clearly there's an understanding that maintaining the independence of the National Treasury, in the wake of attack from unscrupulous elements, is critical and on that basis, business has taken a stand," said political commentator Daniel Silke.Detractors have said Gordhan is too close to business, but he has rejected this.He has said he will not step aside unless he is fired, and he sees his position as one of fighting for social justice. He continues to stand firm over how the South African Revenue Service is managed, on nuclear power expansion, and on the independence of the Treasury.Gordhan has been an activist for more than 40 years - he was detained several times during apartheid, and banned - and has long spoken of social conscience, of working as a collective, of the team, and principles.At the age of 67 he still shows unwavering resolve.The need to improve the welfare of the less fortunate has a major role in defining his world view.Gordhan, speaking to Business Times last week, said: "There's another side as well, a side which asks what business contributes to sustainable development goals and a more sustainable planet. How does business think not only about today but about tomorrow? "Between stints at finance Gordhan was minister of co-operative governance, and was previously a SARS commissioner.Bloomberg reported that, as head of SARS, he revamped its arcane systems and addressed the low levels of tax compliance that were pervasive under apartheid. "Annual revenue collection more than tripled over the decade he was in charge," it said.Gordhan said he was motivated by the Freedom Charter, in particular the first line: "South Africa belongs to all who live in it, black and white."He said: "The challenge, of course, is that 20 years doesn't eradicate centuries of difficulties and so there's harder work to do, and there are more risks as we go ahead ."All those in the faith community, in civil society, in government, in business and in labour who believe that we need a shared and prosperous future for all South Africans would very much like to see the fulfilment of a wider set of objectives that benefitall citizens." Democracy is about holding all of us accountable whether you're in business, labour, government or indeed in any other institution His activist background helped him tremendously, said Gordhan. "It enables you to understand what's going on, it gives you the resilience that's required and the commitment that's required to do the job and do other things that are necessary."Gordhan was involved in the negotiations that led to the democratic elections in 1994. After the ANC came to power, he became chairman of a parliamentary committee that oversaw implementation of the constitution.What does it mean for Gordhan that he's won this award ?"I think it exemplifies the fact that our wider message is now resonating with the business community, the message which says we are all in this together, that it's up to us to change South Africa for the better - not just for business people but for all constituencies."It's recognition that we need an inclusive form of transformation where all South Africans feel that they are part of the process and [among] the beneficiaries."Gordhan said it was about creating mutual hope and optimism, and about reinforcing one another's strengths and resources."I am very grateful for the award, but I don't see this as a personal thing. Government's helping hand to business 'vital in hard times'"I think it's a huge acknowledgement by the business community that we are in this together and that collectively we have the will to change South Africa into a better place."To young business people, he would say: "Have a conscience, do not think only about money."In this very stressful position, how does he relax?"I have an excellent family support system, and try to take time out when I can - I like watching sport, I like reading when I get half a chance so I collect some wisdom ... and cope with what needs to be done on a day-to-day basis."Has the support of the business community come as a surprise to him?"It's good to have citizens involved," he said, adding that it was "fascinating" how "ordinary people" saw through murky situations with greater clarity than some people in more exalted positions did."They understand what is right and what is wrong in South Africa."Democracy is about holding all of us accountable whether you're in business, labour, government or indeed in any other institution. The security of our democracy and the richness of our democracy depend on those citizens."
