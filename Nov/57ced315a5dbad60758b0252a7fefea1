Black on the brows is a no-no.2) Research your permanent make-up technician if you are considering tinting, filling or microblading. Look at "before and after" pictures, because once a permanent mistake is made, it is permanently on your face!Eyebrows are getting out of hand, but that's just how they should be3) Tweezing leads to uneven brows, while shaving the brow removes protection from around the eyes.

Threading is a non-invasive method of hair removal using cotton thread.4) To repair and restore brows that have been over-plucked, stop removing hair and massage with oil or a growth serum.5) The correct length of the brow can be measured using a pencil.

That is where the brow should end.
