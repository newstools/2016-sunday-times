Pastor Lethebo Rabalago of Limpopo clearly thinks otherwise, spraying his congregants with it to expedite the miracles they clearly long for. "We are saying, with God, anything is possible," the Mampara says, challenging beliefs that eating grass or snakes is a surer way to heaven.Little wonder Limpopo's health department says it may be dealing with a "person whose mental state is not sound". Of course, prophets through the ages have suffered similar doubt.In the meantime, congregants should follow manufacturer Tiger Brands' advice to "wash thoroughly with soap and lukewarm water".
