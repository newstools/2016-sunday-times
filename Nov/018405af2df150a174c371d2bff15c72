After a career that notched up three albums, four South African Music Awards, one MTV award, more than 50 songs and 1,000 performances, the Freshlyground co-founder is on the brink of recording his first solo album, set for release in April next year.He's making his dream a reality through the generosity of music fans around the world.Turest-Swartz - who is using the stage name Aron Halevi - raised over R50,000 in the first four weeks from 60 backers through crowd-funding."I have always dreamt of starting a solo career, but I don't think I was ready until now. I used to feel more comfortable being behind the scenes - I felt safer and less vulnerable."Now I feel a sense of urgency to make this dream a reality - this is my one life and if I don't give this everything I've got, I will always regret it," he said.Turest-Swartz co-founded Freshlyground in 2002, during the final year of his BA degree at the University of Cape Town.Singer gets another chance at life"I left in 2009 after seven years in the band. My son was two years and I wanted to be more present as a father and husband. At that stage, we were away from home almost every weekend, and touring overseas a lot."He collaborated with the group's lead singer Zolani Mahola on a few projects after leaving the band."Obviously, leaving Freshlyground was a difficult decision to make. Creative consensus is always a challenge in a group of that size [it is a seven-member band] but our diversity was what made us unique."While we didn't always see eye to eye, we still have a lot of mutual respect for each other."Turest-Swartz went on to collaborate with convicted burglar Larry Joe, recording his debut album Crazy Life inside a cell at Douglas prison in the Northern Cape.He has gone the crowd-funding route to give people "the opportunity to be part of a journey - to invest in a dream and then watch it unfold"."All the songs are written, the studio is booked and all the musicians are booked."Turest-Swartz will released the album on Freedom Day, because it symbolises "the beginning of a new journey - freedom from being behind the scenes"."I've always found it hard to put music into genres, but people have said my songs remind them of Coldplay, Leonard Cohen and Imagine Dragons," he said.
