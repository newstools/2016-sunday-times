We invited 30 Sunday Times Food readers to the HTA School of Culinary Art in Randburg, Joburg, to act as judges.The boerewors was browned in a little oil on a flat top then roasted in the oven to complete the cooking. The hot boerewors was served to the panel of judges in unmarked dishes and tasted first on its own and then with tomato sauce.Auditor Stephanie Pardoe was on hand to monitor the process, from removing the packaging and numbering the samples to the preparation and judging. Pardoe collated the scores.A juicy sausage covered in a tender casing containing a coarse (not too fine) mixture of pork and beef, not too fatty, with a hint of coriander.
