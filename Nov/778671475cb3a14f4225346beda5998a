According to the diviners at food and restaurant consultancy group Baum + Whiteman in New York, "bowls" will become even more popular as the serving vessel of 2017.The report, which is based on trends that emerged in the last year, predicts that the popularity of meals served in bowls will become even more mainstream in 2017, in the vein of acai, poke, smoothie and Buddha bowls which were all over food blogs and Pinterest this year.Healthy food can bowl you over The concept of "bowl food" is particularly popular among the disciples of virtuous eating.Buddha bowls, for instance, are popular among vegans of the Pinterest and YouTube crowd, and usually include a base of grains like quinoa and greens, topped with ingredients like sliced avocado, roasted vegetables like sweet potatoes or cauliflower, nuts and seeds.Smoothie bowls are also highly Instagrammable, usually garnished with rows of fresh fruit, nuts and seeds arranged neatly to make them photogenic.British food writer Nigella Lawson saw enough merit in the trend to devote a chapter to it in her cookbook Simply Nigella for those cozy nights on the sofa."For me, 'bowl food' is simply shorthand for food that is simultaneously soothing, bolstering, undemanding and sustaining," she wrote.It's a trend accelerated by the continued obsession with ramen and the mainstream popularity of Korean bibimbap, which are often served in artisan-style stone pots and bowls, add experts at Baum + Whiteman."What's more, if you hold a bowl Buddha-like while eating, you are psychologically more prone to mindfulness about your meal," the report adds."You'll also stand a better chance of catching all the flavors and textures with every bite ... and think you're full a lot faster, even if you chuck the white carbs."
