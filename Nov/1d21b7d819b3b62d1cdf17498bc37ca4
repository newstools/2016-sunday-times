In a US election season already characterised by unprecedented levels of inflammatory rhetoric and partisan tensions, the announcement on Friday last week by FBI director James Comey, that law enforcement officials had discovered new evidence pertinent to an earlier investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private e-mail server, sent shockwaves through the campaign.Republican candidate Donald Trump, eager to shift the conversation away from public allegations by a dozen women that he had sexually assaulted them, pounced by calling his Democratic opponent's e-mail controversy a scandal "bigger than Watergate".The ramifications were immediate: Clinton's lead, which had climbed into double digits in some polls, almost evaporated.With the race impossible to call heading into Tuesday's election, it is time to seriously ponder the implications for South Africa of a Clinton or Trump presidency. Trump win will be a 'populist crisis'Just as the election offers American voters a choice between two starkly different domestic policy visions, South Africans will be living in two vastly different geopolitical worlds based on which candidate wins.As a former first lady, two-term senator and secretary of state, Clinton is this race's known quantity. She visited South Africa twice, in 2009 and 2012, during her four years as President Barack Obama's secretary of state, and reportedly established a good working relationship with International Relations Minister Maite Nkoana-Mashabane.As Obama's chief emissary at the time, Clinton played an important role in expanding the two US programmes that have most benefited South Africa: the President's Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (Pepfar) and the African Growth and Opportunity Act (Agoa).Under Pepfar, the US contributes more than $400-million (about R5.4-billion) annually to battle Aids in South Africa, while Agoa gives South Africa duty-free access to the US market.Clinton also used her four years as secretary of state to build a new geopolitical narrative about the US's significance to Africa.During an August 2012 visit to Senegal, she contrasted the US's commitment to "democracy and universal human rights" to China's, with its single-minded focus on extracting resources. Clinton pledged a commitment to "a model of sustainable partnership that adds value, rather than extracts it" from Africa.More broadly, Clinton has proved herself an ardent internationalist, both during her term as secretary of state and through the work of her family's foundation. During an August campaign speech in front of the war veterans of the American Legion, she touted the US's military and economic might, as well as the appeal of its "values", and characterised the US as "the indispensable nation".The statement was a fitting summary of Clinton's international outlook, which is premised on the ideal of resolute American military, political and economic leadership. But Clinton has also proved willing to bend her ideals in the face of political pressure. Clinton's record makes it likely that she will seek to sustain, even expand, ties with South Africa The clearest case in point is her recent wavering on the merits of global free trade. In the past, Clinton was one of the most ardent supporters of free trade deals such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which she called the "gold standard" of trade agreements.But under pressure from, first, Bernie Sanders, and then Trump, Clinton changed her tune to accommodate the increasingly vocal populist calls against free trade, saying that the deal "didn't meet my standards".Clinton's record makes it likely that she will seek to sustain, even expand, ties with South Africa. But in spite of her internationalist instincts, she may find it difficult to introduce further trade or aid measures in a domestic political setting characterised by increasing Republican isolationism and an emerging anti-free trade consensus.On the other hand, Trump is perfectly positioned to profit from the US's rising isolationist sentiment.Trump's contempt for foreigners has become almost legendary - after all, he launched his campaign in July 2015 with a tirade about building walls to keep "them" out. On South Africa, Trump believes the country is a "crime-ridden mess that is just waiting to explode".Although his foreign policy positions are maddeningly vague, they are perhaps best encapsulated by a campaign speech he delivered in July this year, titled "America first". Clintipathy could win the dayTrump's world view is premised on a transactional approach to politics, in which the US would simply "walk away" from any economic and political deals that it regards as unbeneficial. This puts Agoa in immediate jeopardy, as it is a nonreciprocal pact explicitly designed to benefit African economies.On the security front, Trump has broken with bipartisan precedent by threatening to withdraw military support to Nato allies that supposedly short-change the US.He has also shown an affinity for autocrats, repeatedly praising strongmen leaders like Russia's Vladimir Putin and Turkey's Recep Erdogan.In Africa, this points to the strong possibility that a Trump presidency would be marked by a reduced emphasis on democratic values and an increase in support for autocrats.From a South African point of view, Tuesday's election pits a flawed status quo internationalist with a record of involvement in South Africa against a political novice who also happens to be a xenophobic isolationist.Just as in the rest of the world, the stark differences between these two candidates make this the most important US election in recent history.Schreiber is a senior research specialist at Princeton University.
