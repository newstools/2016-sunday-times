Atlantic Beach Golf Estate is listed as a luxurious lifestyle manor where the wealthy can enjoy views of the Atlantic and Table Mountain while playing the 18-hole golf course.But things are not as tranquil among the 860 residents who have been teeing off in court.The conflict over the beauty salon, as well as a planned Woolworths store on the estate, has dragged city hall into the controversy. Some hate their neighbours ...Residents have opted for costly litigation to shut down the businesses, which they believe threaten security and the estate's exclusivity.Homes on the Melkbosstrand estate range between R1.5-million and R15-million.Harry White, the CEO of Atlantic Beach Homeowners' Association, hauled the city council and Atlantic Beach Management, which manages the golf club, before the High Court in Cape Town to stop the business activities.The city has been drawn in because the residents complained that the management company contravened a restrictive title-deed condition registered with the deeds office, as well as a municipal by-law.But Allen Usher, a director of Atlantic Beach Management who also owns a home on the estate, slapped the residents with a counter suit to shut down a gym and cafeteria at the leisure centre.Usher also dismissed the security fears as unfounded. He said the majority of the beauty salon clients were the residents themselves.The impasse has been going on since 2006 when residents objected to Usher operating his estate agency from part of the clubhouse.The residents approached the High Court in Cape Town in December last year over this matter."I have personally witnessed events which are being carried on at the clubhouse and which have no bearing whatsoever on the prescribed use of the erf as a 'golf course' and 'golf club' facility," White said in an affidavit. I estimate that [80%] of the beauty salon's customers are [residents], property owners and their spouses. The rest are members of the general public "These include motorcycle rallies, wedding functions, gala functions, cocktail parties and the like. [The homeowners' association] wishes to ensure that its members are protected from having to live on an estate where the intended atmosphere and ambience is being converted in order to facilitate [Atlantic Beach Management's] commercial gain only and to the disadvantage of [the residents]."But Usher said the residents had allowed him to conduct the businesses on the property for 15 years and had, therefore, "waived their benefit of the titled restriction".He said such activities were widely practised and were acceptable means by which golf clubs supplemented their income, and that the city had consented to this. But city officials disputed this in court.The mayor v.s. the murals: Could Joburg's street art be wiped out?He also said that the beauty salon had operated on the ground floor of the clubhouse since 2002."I estimate that [80%] of the beauty salon's customers are [residents], property owners and their spouses. The rest are members of the general public - typically, the spouse of a golfer who comes for a treatment while the golfer is on the course," Usher said in his affidavit."The security-related concerns are unfounded. In 2000 there was an armed robbery at the golf club but since then there have been no such or similar incidents, nor any incidents of theft or burglaries connected to functions connected to the clubhouse."The high court last week defused the feud, for now. Judge Judy Cloete interdicted the management company from conducting business at the clubhouse.She also interdicted the residents from running the gym and restaurant at the leisure centre.The residents' lawyer, Anneke Whelan of Shepstone &amp; Wylie Attorneys, said: "The interdict is, however, suspended for six months in order to allow the golf club manager to redress the unlawfulness of the activities conducted at the golf clubhouse."She said residents considered the judgment a victory and would not appeal the interdict.nombembep@sundaytimes.co.za
