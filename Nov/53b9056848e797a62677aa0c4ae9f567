After 124 tests over 12 seasons, veteran wing Bryan Habana is giving a little more consideration to the next phase of his life as the end of his playing days comes into focus.The searing pace of 2004-2010 has given way to better reading of the game, but time works against all great athletes and Habana is not immune.He's well aware that he is in the gloaming of a storied career, which has brought a record 66 test tries, a World Cup winners' medal and a World Player of the Year award among many other titles.Springboks hit rock bottom with crushing loss to ItalyBut he's not willing to admit that the next seven days could be his last as a Springbok.Habana is such a fierce competitor that he wouldn't even rule out a tilt at the 2019 Rugby World Cup, even though he would be 36 by Japan 2019."Pushing through to Rugby World Cup 2019 is not something I've thought about," Habana says. "It all depends on who the coach is and what the situation is. I will re-evaluate later because I only want to be picked on form and not because I'm Bryan Habana."Japan 2019 is a long way off. All I want to do right now is contribute positively to the Boks and [club] Toulon."My contract with Toulon ends in June next year and I'm in negotiations about possibly staying on. My body is feeling good even though I haven't had much rest in the past few years."I still have seven months of club rugby to play in the northern hemisphere, so I won't be making decisions before then."Part of Habana's reluctance to make any firm proclamations about his future is that SA Rugby has not formally made a decision on whether overseas-based players will be eligible for the Boks from 2017 onwards.If that loophole closes, Habana would be forced to choose between club and country. At the tail end of his career, Toulon and their generous chequebook might win."When I first moved to Toulon they knew that I still wanted to play for the Springboks, which I stipulated in my contract," Habana says."Toulon are a little unhappy with me. Over the past four years I have missed about 32 games due to my Springbok commitments. I understand their frustration because I'm never involved in the first part of the season. It will be something I take into consideration when I make decisions about the future."SA Rugby is in an interesting situation, from trying to compete with the euro and the pound, as well as dealing with its administrative and governmental policies.Habana pays tribute to murdered teacher"As players, you just want the best 23 wearing that Springbok jersey, so whatever policies are put in place I will trust the powers to make the right call - whether it's five years of Super Rugby, or 50 test caps to be eligible. There have been a lot of rumours doing the rounds but nothing set in stone."Even though no firm decisions have been made about his future, Habana has given some thought to a post-rugby life.He's one of the most marketable figures in the sport and understands that his reputation and image can have a positive impact on the game, and on the lives of people less fortunate than him."Rugby has given me so much, so any decisions I make would have to come after a little break," Habana says. "I have a family to look after and the rest of my life to live. I'd like to stay involved in rugby, but in broader terms there is so much to consider because rugby is debating a global season and better player welfare."I would love to contribute to that side of things, but coaching is probably not on the radar right now."I have a few charity initiatives starting, which is where I'd like to focus some energy as well."My wife has a good little business in Cape Town - a pre- and post-natal training facility - and I would love to have a job working as her secretary three days a week and playing golf on the other two and maybe earn the same salary."But I don't think that is going to be possible."
