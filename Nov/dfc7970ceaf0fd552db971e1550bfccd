The committee is made up of some of the most powerful politicians in South Africa. It influences the decisions of the ANC's highest structure, the national executive committee.It was the ANC NEC that forced then-president Thabo Mbeki out of office in 2008 following a judgment in the High Court in Pietermaritzburg that implicated him in an alleged conspiracy to stop Zuma from ascending to power.Judge Chris Nicholson was subsequently overruled by the Supreme Court of Appeal, but the NEC's decision stood.Hawks eye: Jonas, Zweli and Gwede targetedDon't hold your breath, however, for the working committee to recommend that the NEC recall Zuma.If Zuma's remarks in Dumbe, KwaZulu-Natal, yesterday are anything to go by, he is in a fighting mood and not about to step down.He told party supporters at the Dumbe ANC rally that no one should try to "scare me with jail" as "I spent 10 years in prison".This is the attitude he will take to the working committee today as he resists the small group of ANC leaders who want him gone.Although the ground is definitely shifting in the ANC, Zuma still enjoys enough support within its elected structures to avoid Mbeki's fate.Expect him and his supporters to push for debate on the state capture report to be deferred until he has challenged Thuli Madonsela's findings in court. It is a strategy the president has used to good effect every time he has been in trouble - buying time by hiding behind legal and administrative processes.But the report is too serious to be left in the hands of a political party - especially one that has often proved itself impotent to act against its leader.Instead of waiting on the working committee and the NEC to act, the issue should be brought before the very institution that we South Africans voted for to look after our collective interests - parliament.What ANC NEC members say about Zuma...Zuma stands accused, not for the first time, of breaching his oath of office. It should be the house that elected him president that should act now.Madonsela recommended that a commission of inquiry be appointed to further investigate the damning claims made in her report. However, this does not stop parliament from debating and voting on Zuma's suitability for the highest office in the land.In recent weeks, ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu and several cabinet ministers and parliamentarians have come out publicly to criticise what they see as the abuse of state institutions by the president and those associated with him.These ANC politicians now have an opportunity to put their money where their mouth is by raising the same issues in parliament when the house debates the latest opposition call for a vote of no confidence in the president.Zuma has survived past impeachment attempts because ANC MPs closed ranks and decided to toe the party line. With so many of them now speaking out against Zuma and his excesses, South Africa expects them to vote in a manner that demonstrates their disgust when the issue comes before the National Assembly.
