England were 155 for six at tea, a lead of 157, with a potential 37 overs remaining in the match.The flurry of wickets was in complete contrast to the first four days when both teams scored more than 600 runs in their first innings and 1272 runs were scored for the loss of only 13 wickets.After four days of unrelenting sunshine, the sky was partly overcast on Wednesday.The fast bowlers, led by Morne Morkel, gained some movement, while off-spinner Dane Piedt obtained some turn from a pitch which had previously offered no assistance to the bowlers.Piedt was the most successful bowler, taking three for 38.
