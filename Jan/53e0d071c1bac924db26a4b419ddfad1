South Africa's reign on the test throne ended with them paraded through the streets, pants down to their ankles, amid mockery, ridicule and shame.They were dragged by the English down Corlett Drive, screaming for mercy.You'd like to blame vacuous batting but the cause of the Proteas' batting collapse, which is becoming too familiar, was Stuart Christopher John Broad. South Africans, who packed the Bullring, hardly had time to drink in Kagiso Rabada's first test five-wicket haul before Broad produced a spell reminiscent of the greats.He took us to Trent Bridge, where he dismantled Australia with 8/15 in 9.3 overs last August. Then, Broad's spell had sealed the Ashes for England.Yesterday, he bowled a five-wicket spell that sealed this four-match series.Broad's last five overs of a merciless 10-over spell produced four wicket maidens. He toyed with the Proteas top order. Batsmen one to six's wickets all belonged to him and he was literally falling over himself to catch Faf du Plessis off his own bowling - the wicket that ended South Africa's anguished second innings and gave him figures of 6/17.He's the most verbally abused bowler in cricket - for his supercilious attitude - but as he often does, he rose to the occasion.The Wanderers got to its feet, reverently and begrudgingly, applauding Broad as he walked off.No amount of PG-rated, vile chants from the stands regarding objects and his plumbing derailed him.The banquet of South Africa's return home from a humiliating Indian series has turned into a parade showcasing how far off their own majestic standards the Proteas have fallen.
