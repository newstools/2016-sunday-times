Although there are far fewer financial responsibilities and obligations on tenants, they should still take precautions to insure their own valuables. According to TGI research, only 5% of rented properties are insured with buildings insurance, and only 4% of the tenants have home contents insurance in place.What tenants must realise is that the landlord s liability ends at the four walls they are living in. Tenants can make it easier for themselves by keeping the following tips in mind:Understand the difference between home contents and portable possessions insurance: Home contents insurance covers your furniture, clothes and appliances. Portable possessions insurance covers the things you carry with you, for example laptops, cellphones and sunglasses. Using an inventory form is an easy way to calculate the full value of all of your home contents. It is important to update your household inventory list on a regular basis, to ensure that any new items are included, and to remove items that you no longer have. Make sure that you insure your possessions for their replacement value. The replacement value is what it would cost you, at the time of a claim, to replace all of your belongings with similar brand-new ones. The better the security at the home you are renting, the less you will pay for home contents insurance every month. It s worth speaking to your landlord about installing burglar bars or an alarm, if you don t have these.The author of this article, Warwick Scott-Rodger, is head of Dialdirect.
