1. Get to know your pet s needsEach canine breed has a unique personality and set of needs. Athletic dogs, such as Boxers, Border Collies and Dalmatians, will need ample space to exercise, while the more laid-back breeds French Bulldogs, English Bulldogs and Pugs are perfectly suited to smaller gardens.2. Provide ample shadeDogs get hot very quickly when they are outside, so ensure there are enough shady spots where they can lie down and cool off.How to make your garden more pet-friendly3. Fencing mattersKeep your precious pets safe by fencing off your garden. If you decide to erect a perimeter fence, you will need to consider the breed of your dog to ensure the fence is high enough that your dog can t jump over it. Temporary fencing also helps to protect newly planted flowerbeds.4. Avoid bare soilFlowerbeds with large swathes of uncovered soil are an open invitation to cats and dogs to dig. Plant large trees and shrubs, group clusters of plants together, and cover bare soil with hardy groundcovers.5. Beware of toxic plantsThere are many plant varieties that, if eaten, are toxic to pets. Avoid planting lilies, tulips and oleander, which are known to cause kidney and gastrointestinal damage, and have a range of other serious effects. Also remember to remove thorny plants that can cause injury.6. Provide entertainmentIt s a good idea to allocate a specific zone in your garden to your pets. In this space, you can hang balls from trees, create a sand pit diggers will love this with a few soft and chewable toys, and establish a digging area, where they can bury a bone or their favourite toy. Ensure your dogs are kept hydrated with an abundant supply of fresh water.
