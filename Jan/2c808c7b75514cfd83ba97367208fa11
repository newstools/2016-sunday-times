Viljoen made his Test debut for the Proteas last week in the calamitous defeat at the Wanderers a result which saw England lead the four-Test series 2-0 with one game remaining.The burly seamer built like a rugby flanker (coincidentally a step-brother to Golden Lions loosie Derick Minnie) despite only playing in three of the Highveld Lions four matches still tops the wicket-taking charts of the domestic competition with 21 scalps to his name two more than his nearest challenger the Knights Duanne Olivier.Now Cook 33 stands a chance of making his Test debut for the Proteas when the SA side takes on England in the final Test of the series at Centurion s SuperSport Park this weekend. With a batting average of 83 on the domestic scene Cook tops the averages and is a close second as are as top run-scorers go to Titans veteran Heino Kuhn (450 runs in four matches). The Lions captain has amassed 415 runs in three matches.While the Proteas seem to be struggling in the batting department the old heads on the domestic scene seem to be on a purple patch with the bat.The 31-year-old Kuhn dominated last weekend as he obliterated the Dolphins bowling attack in his team s six- wicket victory over the Durban side.The Titans opener began proceedings with a knock of 129 in the first innings before adding a further 62 runs in the second to steer the Centurion-based side to victory.In the opposition team 31-year-old Imran Khan who opened the batting for the Dolphins responded with 83 runs in the first innings which was followed by 107 in the second.While the veterans Cook Kuhn and Khan have been leading the batting pack with distinction it remains somewhat of a worry that the younger batsmen in the domestic competition are yet to stamp their authority and give hope of bolstering the national team in the long run.The inclusion of the 33-year-old Cook to the Proteas side will only serve as a temporary stopgap to the batting woes of Russell Domingo s side. What about the future? Who will eventually fill the gaps left by Graeme Smith and Jacques Kallis? What happens when Hashim Amla and AB de Villiers hang up their bats?The younger batsmen need to step up on the domestic scene.In the bowling department however there seems to be no shortage of talent.Dwaine Pretorius ensured the Lions remained unbeaten and in second place with an impressive 6-72 from the two innings against the Knights while Tumi Masekela despite his team s defeat put together a stellar performance finishing with figures of 9-76.This week s matches will see a top-of-the-table clash between the Titans and Lions in Potchefstroom. The Dolphins will be at home against the Cobras in Durban while the bottom-of-the-log Warriors will host the Knights in East London. TMG Digital
