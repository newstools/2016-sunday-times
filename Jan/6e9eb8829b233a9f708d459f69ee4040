On Monday, Zuma announced Lesotho would be booted out of the Southern African Development Community after it refused to accept a SADC report into the killing at a double troika summit in Gaborone.Parts of the explosive so-called assassination report leaked to the Sunday Times reveal that it recommends sacking Lesotho Defence Force head and former coup plotter Tlali Kamoli and defence minister Tseliso Mokhosi to bring stability to the country.The report is also scathing of the Lesotho government and its defence force s actions during a military operation that led to the death of former defence force chief Lieutenant-General Maaparankoe Mahao last June.mini_story_image_hleft1It said the government showed a lack of accountability over the Lesotho Defence Force s actions during the operation, suggesting it was covering up for its operatives who killed Mahao and, bemoaning that the criminal investigation into the killing was stalled.It also criticised the military s failure to release exhibits as well as persistent threats and previous attempts on the life of Brigadier Mahao by LDF actors .The report was produced by an SADC-appointed commission headed by Botswana judge Mphaphi Phumaphi.Phumaphi s report was completed in October but Mosisili refused to accept it or co-operate with the commission, citing a legal challenge by a senior army officer implicated in the killing. This angered the SADC security troika of Mozambique, South Africa and Tanzania, which said Lesotho s courts had no jurisdiction over the commission.Zuma s announcement this week that Lesotho would be suspended from SADC prompted a dramatic climb-down by Mosisili. The following day he accepted the Phumaphi report and agreed to release it by February 1.But on his return to Lesotho on Wednesday he appeared to renege on his promises, telling a press conference he would release and implement the report selectively.He also lashed out at Zuma, accusing the South African president of double standards by resisting external pressure to arrest Sudan s President Omar al-Bashir while trying to force Lesotho to bend to SADC s will on the Mahao report.Mahao s family are convinced he was assassinated after trumped-up charges of plotting a mutiny were levelled against him.In last June s reign of terror, 21 of his supporters were rounded up in the streets of Maseru and taken to military camps where they were tortured. They later appeared in court bleeding and in shackles.They face a court martial on February 1 on mutiny charges which their lawyers claim were trumped up. Reign of terror grips LesothoIn December the troika dispatched South African Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, the SADC-appointed peace facilitator, to convey concerns about the court challenge to the commission of inquiry , his spokesman, Ronnie Mamoepa, said this week.Ramaphosa s report on this Lesotho visit and Phumaphi s report were both discussed at a troika summit in Gaborone this week, said Mamoepa.Mosisili s decision to cave in to pressure by Zuma to accept the Phumaphi report was widely hailed. But his U-turn once back in Lesotho has fuelled fears among opposition leaders and civil society that the government intends releasing a doctored report and will probably water down its most controversial recommendations, including that of sacking its military top brass.Mosisili s spokesman, Motumi Ralejoe, confirmed on Friday that Mosisili reserved the right to take legal advice and redact portions of the report on grounds of national security before tabling it in parliament in February. Parts that might cause instability might be expunged, he said.The report emphasises that security reforms should focus on depoliticising the Lesotho military.Evidence provided to the commission in camera by a former principal secretary revealed that military recruitment was based on political affiliation, which results in politicisation of the security sector .The report recommends strengthening a parliamentary defence oversight committee and creating a code of conduct to regulate how political parties interact with the Lesotho Defence Force.
