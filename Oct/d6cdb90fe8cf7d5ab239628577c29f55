Antoine Griezmann has revealed he is a big fan of Manchester United - and that could pave the way for a summer move to Old Trafford.The Atletico Madrid forward, who has been linked with United, follows them on TV and is great mates with world-record summer-signing and France teammate Paul Pogba, according to The Sun.That friendship could be crucial if boss Jose Mourinho wants to pursue a move for the hot-shot who won the Golden Boot at the European Championships with six goals."We get on very well," Griezmann said. "It is true that the Euros has brought us closer together still. Paul is a really nice guy. He is it!"We send messages, Snapchats. He's really a good friend. When he plays with his club, I try to look at it to see if he had a good game or not."Griezmann, who blasted 33 goals last season, could be a replacement for Wayne Rooney, whose United career appears to be winding down.Face-off over IscoARSENAL and Tottenham are said to be set to go head to head in a bid to sign Real Madrid midfielder Isco again in January, according to Diario Madrisista in Spain.Both north London clubs have been credited with an interest in the 24-year-old for more than a year, being linked with a move for the Spain international in a number of transfer windows, with claims that Spurs made a late move to take him on loan on transfer deadline day last month.The Spanish outlet reports that the Champions League holders will be willing to listen to offers for the man who has played 100 La Liga games for the club, as they could otherwise be forced to sell him in a cut-price deal over the summer as his contract begins to wind down.The Gunners aren't only fighting their rivals in the transfer market though, with TuttoMercatoWeb running a report claiming that Arsene Wenger's side are getting ready to throw down with Liverpool for the services of Genoa forward Leonardo Pavoletti.The sides, who both have their sights set on a Premier League title challenge this season, are believed to have sent scouts to watch the 27-year-old striker in action recently as they consider a move for the one-time Leeds United target.Pavoletti has 24 goals from 41 games for the Serie A side in all competitions, form which earned him a call-up to the Italian national team in August as his star continues to rise.Wenger's decision to play Alexis Sanchez as his leading man up front has left Olivier Giroud stuck on the bench for much of the season, and it's unclear whether Pavoletti would slot in behind or ahead of the Frenchman on the club's depth chart. theweek.co.uk
