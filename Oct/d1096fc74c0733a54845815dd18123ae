The stock fell as much as 6%, the most since June. The drop imperilled the company's position as Europe's biggest company by market value, a status it only gained this month when the takeover was completed after a year-long process.The biggest area of weakness was Brazil, ABInBev's second-largest market, where slack consumption was compounded by delays to price hikes into the fourth quarter. The brewer also acknowledged that cracks are appearing in the US craft beer boom.More than ever, ABInBev will be relying on achieving the $1.4-billion of annual savings it has said it can get from combining with SABMiller."One would have to seriously question a positive stance on stand-alone ABInBev," Eamonn Ferry, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas, wrote in a note to investors. "The thesis for us here is very centred on the acquisition of SABMiller."At one point this week the company's market value was about 217-billion (about R3-trillion). Nestl , displaced by the brewer as Europe's biggest company by market capitalisation this month, is valued at the equivalent of $228-billion.In addition to reporting a surprise drop in third-quarter profit, ABInBev cut its revenue forecast, saying it no longer expects sales growth to beat inflation in 2016 because of declining volumes in Brazil.

ABInBev joins Nestl , Danone and Unilever in wrestling with a consumer slump and inflation in the South American country.ABInBev's ebitda in Brazil declined by 33%, driven by currency hedges linked to the cost effect of the real's devaluation.The drag was expected to continue in the fourth quarter and ease in mid-2017, the company said. Revenue dropped 6.8% in that market as the brewer delayed adjusting prices until the fourth quarter, it said.Consumer prices rose 8.5% in Brazil in September year on year, and economists forecast 5% inflation in 2017, according to a central bank survey. ABInBev previously cut its forecast for Brazilian revenue in July, predicting unchanged sales.The brewer also announced a 2% drop in SABMiller's beer volume due to weakness in Africa and a strike in Colombia.In the US, ABInBev's sales to retailers fell 3.8% in the quarter, more than the wider industry, with Bud Light showing a mid-single-digit decline. The market was weighed down partly by a slowdown in the craft beer category.The brewer anticipates modest dividend growth in the near term and has no plans to cut the payout to below 1.60 a share.The SABMiller results were not consolidated in ABInBev's figures, and excluded joint ventures and assets that were sold or are up for sale.- Bloomberg
