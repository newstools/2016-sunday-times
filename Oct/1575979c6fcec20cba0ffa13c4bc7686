But not even his staunchest supporters would deny that Zuma's presidency is now at its weakest.His battles with the public protector's office as well as the National Treasury have exposed fissures that cut through his political party and, more recently, his cabinet.As he flew to India on Friday, Zuma knew that he no longer presided over a united executive.His ministers are split between those who back his relationship with the controversial Gupta family and those who are slowly gaining their voice in opposing what they see as attempts by the family, and others linked to Zuma, to capture the state for their own commercial ends.We report in this edition about a number of ministers who have come out publicly in support of embattled Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan. These ministers are but the first of many other cabinet members who are preparing to do so.Signs that Zuma is losing his grip on the cabinet were visible a fortnight ago when the executive effectively called for Zuma's point man at the SABC, Hlaudi Motsoeneng, to be sacked and for the board to resign.That Motsoeneng and the few remaining members of the SABC board are still in office is only due to the fact that the minister responsible, Faith Muthambi, is a Zuma loyalist.The cabinet also distanced itself from the actions of another Zuma loyalist, Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane, forcing the president to do the same.But how long can this standoff between Zuma and his executive go on without it being resolved one way or the other? The one thing that is clear is that, whereas Zuma still has control over enough of the ANC's structures to avoid being recalled by the party, he has lost the confidence of many of his key ministers.The disagreements over Gordhan and the public protector's investigation into "state capture" are only some of the terrain on which the battle between the president and sections of his executive is being fought.The infighting may not bode well for service delivery as it means ministers' energies are being wasted on fighting one another. But, on the upside, it is great for our country and its future.It signals a sea change, where those in positions of authority do not turn a blind eye to what is going on in the country just because they fear losing their jobs.Gordhan's decision, for instance, to approach the courts for an order declaring that the cabinet has no legal authority to intervene on behalf of the Guptas in their dispute with the country's major banks, is a step in the right direction.The Guptas have sought to use their proximity to power to force the banks to back down on their decision to close the accounts of the family and its businesses without having to go through the courts.If the order is granted, it would mean an end to Zwane's attempt to have the government help out the Guptas. It also means that, even if Zuma removes Gordhan from the Finance Ministry, his successor would not be pressured to act as an agent for the Guptas in their fight with the banks.For Zuma it will be yet another blow, proving once again that even though his demise may not be imminent, his power is diminishing.
