Not only did Kuber Eadhev Singh, 75, of KwaDukuza, produce two thrones, a table for the royal stick and a podium for the Zulu monarch, he also made thrones for each of the king's six queens and six tables on which each could place her handbag.Singh, who uses the wood of the indigenous tamboti tree for his creations, produced the furniture for the Zulu royal family in 2014.But the craftsman has not yet been paid, despite more than 40 phone calls and several e-mails to the king's aide Nhlavuyelanga Sithole, who used to visit Singh's workshop at least twice a week to check on his progress in making the items.This week Singh claimed that Sithole, who had promised him that he would be paid within a month of finishing the work, was now ignoring his calls or abruptly cutting them off."I am 75 and I'm not a very rich man but a craftsman," he said. "I don't know what to do. I'm very sad that they have not paid me. That was a special price I gave, thinking that I was doing it for the king, as it was an honour for me to do that."Singh said he almost collapsed last month when he saw the Zulu king on TV, sitting on the same throne he had made during King Shaka Day celebrations at Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban.The king's spokesman, Prince Thulani Zulu, referred queries to Sithole, who said the matter of Singh's payment was being dealt with. Sithole blamed the delay on the KwaZulu-Natal provincial government's decision last year to scrap the royal household department."The other problem is that he never finished the order on time. But we are resolving the matter," he said.</img>King Goodwill Zwelithini sitting on the other throne made by Kuber Singh.
