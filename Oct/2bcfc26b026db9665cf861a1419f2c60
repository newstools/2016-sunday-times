Fashion s turnover of trends is not only insatiable, but also, more often than not, unwearable for the average woman. Whether we re talking thigh-grazing hemlines or obliques-revealing cut-outs, what looks good on the catwalk can appear indecent or frumpy on the sidewalk. So hallelujah for our current obsession with the off-the-shoulder look.It s a trend that oozes subtle sexiness and makes the most of the part of the body every woman can feel good about. Who doesn t love their collarbones, right? It s no wonder the world is shoulder-flash crazy now.WATCH: Can Jozi challenge Dubai as a world shopping destination?That said the off-the-shoulder look has been a perennial favourite for longer than you might think. It was popular throughout the 19th century, as well as in the 1950s and 1970s.What makes 2016 s incarnation of the trend feel invigorating and empowering is that, unlike in recent decades, when off-the-shoulder tops were most often about defining the waist and hugging the body, today we re taking a softer, more demure approach. The aim is to give the impression that garments are floating around the body, about to cascade to the floor. Not only is this alluring, it s also ultimately flattering.The look reframes the body too. These seemingly precarious garments change the way you carry yourself, and demand that you walk and stand tall. No slouching, or you ll be flashing more than you intended, but that s very much part of their elegant charm. What I find appealing (about this trend) is the sense of undone femininity. Baring a shoulder allows you to feel sexy, but still sophisticated and relaxed. It is more suggestive than revealing, says London-based designer Serafina Sama of Isa Arfen, who's been incorporating off-the-shoulder styles into her collections since her very first season. The search for the next erogenous zone has been moving so fast in the past couple of years that there was nothing left to bare. So I think it s refreshing to start covering up again except for an exposed shoulder, she adds.Johannesburg-based designer Thula Sindi agrees. Instagram, baby! There s nothing like looking sultry as your dress or top seems to be held up by a prayer. It s true this trend was born for social media. Adopt a winning smile, glance over one s conveniently uncovered shoulder in a pseudo-coy pose, and then snap, post, and like.Here are some local celebrities who've been doing just that:Amanda du-Pont A photo posted by Amanda du-Pont (@amandadupont) on Sep 1, 2016 at 12:59am PDT A photo posted by Amanda du-Pont (@amandadupont) on Aug 26, 2016 at 2:29am PDT Bonang Matheba A photo posted by Bonang Matheba (@bonang_m) on Sep 13, 2016 at 12:04pm PDT A photo posted by Bonang Matheba (@bonang_m) on Jul 2, 2016 at 3:59am PDT A photo posted by Bonang Matheba (@bonang_m) on Jun 25, 2016 at 3:42pm PDT A photo posted by Bonang Matheba (@bonang_m) on Jun 23, 2016 at 9:21am PDT Candice SwanepoelA photo posted by Candice Swanepoel (@angelcandices) on May 12, 2016 at 7:21pm PDT Ayanda Thabethe A photo posted by Ayanda Thabethe (@ayandathabethe_) on Sep 11, 2016 at 11:57am PDT A photo posted by Ayanda Thabethe (@ayandathabethe_) on Aug 27, 2016 at 3:35am PDT A photo posted by Ayanda Thabethe (@ayandathabethe_) on Aug 27, 2016 at 2:48am PDT A photo posted by Ayanda Thabethe (@ayandathabethe_) on Aug 7, 2016 at 2:07pm PDT Jeannie DA photo posted by Jeannie D (@iamjeannied) on Jun 8, 2016 at 8:02am PDT This article is adapted from one originally published in 'Sunday Times The Edit Spring/Summer '16'.
