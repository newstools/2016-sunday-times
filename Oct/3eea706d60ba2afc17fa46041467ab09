Lower-than-projected growth, emerging public wage pressures and rising contingent liabilities caused by the propping up of financially weak state-owned enterprises such as SAA are significant risks to the effective implementation of the budget, said Moody's analyst Zuzana Brixiova."Spending pressures are also likely to rise in the run-up to the 2019 elections," she said.The world's three leading credit rating agencies -- S&amp;P Global Ratings, Fitch and Moody's - acknowledged Gordhan's efforts to slow down spending, but said he had failed to introduce stronger economic and structural reforms.Gardner Rusike, associate director of S&amp;P Global Ratings, said the slower fiscal consolidation path was unexpected but "within acceptable areas"."We're not expecting significant fiscal improvement. Our base case is that the Treasury sticks to the February budget targets." Business spots ray of hope after mini-budget ...He said the February budget had been stronger in explaining what needed to be achieved but the October medium-term budget did not demonstrate a lot of progress on the matters the government had said it would address.The agencies are due to review their country ratings over the next two months, and may decide to downgrade South Africa to sub-investment grade, or "junk".The rand has been declining against major currencies since budget day on the back of low growth expectations.Although some analysts have already priced in South Africa's slide to junk status following Turkey's recent downgrade, confirmation would weaken an already fragile domestic currency.In response to the rise in inflation that it would trigger, the Reserve Bank would in all likelihood have to further raise borrowing costs to support the rand.In a note, Fitch said poor economic performance remained the main hurdle to stabilising debt.Structural reform measures highlighted in the budget, such as efforts to "reduce legal uncertainty in the mining sector or improved visa processing, will not be sufficient to raise business confidence substantially in the near term", it said.A review of South Africa's mining charter led by the Department of Mineral Resources has yet to be released. The uncertainty has dented the confidence of mining companies, prompting them to put any expansion plans on ice.In the country's favour, Fitch noted the progress made in alleviating electricity shortages - a major factor holding back growth in recent years.Revenue-raising measures next year will come at a sensitive time - in the same year as the ANC electoral conference where a new presidential candidate will be selected, Fitch said. It's important to get the economic reforms on track as well as the political dynamics on the same path and same direction "Positioning by potential candidates, as well as concerns following the poor showing of the ANC in local elections in August, may make unpopular tax measures politically difficult and heighten pressure for additional spending."The National Treasury has proposed tax measures to raise an additional R13-billion next year but Gordhan said further details would only be provided in February.The Treasury said operating budgets for national departments will be cut by 1.1% and proposed a reduction of the spending ceiling by R10-billion in the 2017-2018 financial year and another cut of R16- billion in the following financial year.Brixiova said the effective implementation of these measures would continue to be challenged by slow progress and uncertainty around structural reforms to support growth. Pressuring the president but steering clear of a showdownGovernment spending currently exceeds R1-trillion annually. Since 2009, a growing portion has been funded by borrowing.Slower-than-expected revenue growth from taxes has meant that the budget deficit - the gap between spending and revenue - will be 3.4% of GDP for the year instead of 3.2% forecast in the February budget.The Treasury expects the deficit to fall to 3.1% in the 2017-2018 financial year and to 2.7% in the 2018-2019 year. In the 2019-2020 year the deficit is projected to be 2.5%.Fitch says the deterioration in economic growth and budget deficit forecasts could have been worse without new fiscal consolidation measures tabled in the medium-term budget.S&amp;P Global Ratings is the only agency to have South Africa on the lowest investment grade rating - BBB- with a negative outlook.Rusike said: "As to the impact on the overall ratings ... I cannot say right now. It depends on other factors as well. The biggest factors that have got strong weighting are institutional and economic assessments. So it's important to get the economic reforms on track as well as the political dynamics on the same path and same direction."
