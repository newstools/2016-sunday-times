The Icefields Parkway is, with good reason, one of the world's most spectacular driving tours.As the official website describes the drive, "The Icefields Parkways, known as Highway 93 North, offers spectacular sightseeing of pristine turquoise lakes, tumbling waterfalls, ancient glaciers and the Columbia Icefields. Take the ultimate road trip: Vietnam in an old US Army Jeep "Along the stretch, big-horn sheep, deer, black bears, and coyotes are frequently spotted."Wolves, grizzlies and goats less so. But witnessing a truly wild sight, like a trio of infant bear cubs under the protection of their mother, is not unlikely."The first time I drove the route that stretches 232km between Jasper and Banff in Canada, I went around the first corner and said: "That's the most amazing view I've ever seen!"I then did the same at pretty much every corner on the route past lovely lakes, soaring mountains, tumbling waterfalls, glittering glaciers and pine-clad valleys.Stay in two former Canadian Pacific Railway hotels along the way. Fairmont Chateau Lake Louise, with the mountains behind and the lake in front, has a superb location and doubles from CA$339.The Fairmont Banff Springs Hotel has been known as "The Castle in the Rockies" since it was built 125 years ago; and offers doubles from CA$399.Do the Parkway in style in a chauffeur-driven 1952 Bentley Mark VI affectionately called Dorothy, booked through Highland VIP.Road Trip India offers several 4x4 self-drive tours, the most exciting being its 18-day Trans-Himalayan Expedition from Delhi to Manali and Leh, then back to Delhi via Amritsar.I have done much of this route by motorbike, and it is unforgettable. Price: 2,577 per person, excluding flights.The most familiar PCH option is the Los Angeles to San Francisco route. Equally compelling, if not more so, is the stretch north from there, taking you through northern California then along the rugged coast of Oregon and Washington state to Seattle and Vancouver.My favourite place to stay en route is the Tu Tu' Tun Lodge in Oregon, with all the raw essentials for rural life and gourmet cooking; doubles from $235.For car enthusiasts, classiccarhireworld.com is a good starting point for classic rentals worldwide.If you haven't done America's Route 66, do: 90% of it is still there, complete with 1950s motels, diners, gas stations and hokey attractions.Scenic Car Tours offers 22-day self-drive tours from 2,649 including flights, or more for a range of American classics. - The Sunday Telegraph
