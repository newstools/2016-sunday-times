Xavier Pr vost, a coal analyst at XMP Consulting, said this week that reserves in Mpumalanga, the hub of South Africa's coal mining industry, could be exhausted in 40 or 50 years.The province, which is home to most of Eskom's ageing coal-fired power stations, has reserves of about 21.5billion tons, about 67% of the total for South Africa, according to Pr vost.So will South Africa's other major coal region, the Waterberg in Limpopo, where Eskom already has two power stations - including Medupi - be able to fill the future supply gap for local energy needs and for exports?Amcu reaches pay deal with AmplatsKnown reserves in the Waterberg are estimated to be sufficient to meet about 40% of South Africa's needs for power generation and exports.Pr vost is sceptical. "The Waterberg ... [has] lots of resources, very little reserves.""Resource" means the amount estimated on the basis of relatively limited testing, whereas "reserve" is the amount considered to be economically viable to mine following a feasibility study."Waterberg is one of the most difficult mining areas in the country. It has no water, no road or rail infrastructure and is too far from the markets," Pr vost said.Sasol at one time investigated the possibility of using Waterberg coal for a coal-to-liquids plant, Project Mafutha, but decided not to proceed because of "the high capital costs, water constraints and shortages in Limpopo".Sasol said this week that other considerations included the greenhouse gas emissions associated with coal-to-liquid plants."A commercially and environmentally sound option to mitigate emissions of greenhouse gases will not be available in the foreseeable future," it said.Global climate change policies which discouraged carbon-intensive operations were a risk, as were carbon taxes locally.Sasol said Project Mafutha was not commercially viable and "is not part of our broader refined strategy to move towards lower-carbon energy alternatives such as using natural gas as a primary feedstock of our operations".Doug Kuni, MD of the South African Independent Power Producers Association, said the coal reserves remaining in South Africa were mostly in the Waterberg."Coal has been mined in the Waterberg for more than 30 years now. Medupi was built because coal can be mined there economically."Eskom's new 4,764MW Medupi power station near Lephalale, and the older Matimba power station, are fed by Exxaro's Grootgeluk mine. Additional to rail infrastructure capacity, affordable rail rates from the Waterberg to both domestic and export markets will be a key enabler of Waterberg coal development Exxaro, which believes there are nearly 76billion tons of "inferred resources" in 11 coal-bearing zones in the Waterberg, is developing a second mine in the region, Thabametsi. But the company acknowledges that water and transport links are problems.Eskom spokesman Khulu Phasiwe said: "Both Medupi and Matimba use direct dry-cooling technology, meaning that they use air for cooling and thereby use less water."The choice of dry-cooling technology for Matimba and Medupi was largely influenced by the scarcity of water in the area."He said that since the 1980s Eskom had reduced its water consumption from 2.85litres per kilowatt-hour to roughly 1.44litres per kilowatt-hour last year."The bulk-water requirements for our coal-fired power stations have been secured until March 31 2017. This allows time for a new water supply agreement to be negotiated with the Department of Water and Sanitation, once the revised national water pricing strategy is gazetted," Phasiwe said.Stakeholders in the Waterberg region have been banking on obtaining enough water to meet the needs of agriculture, mining and power generation from the Mokolo-Crocodile Water Augmentation Project, which involves pumping water from the Vaal system, but so far the supply has not been adequate. Pressuring the president but steering clear of a showdownExxaro, the only large mining company operating in the Waterberg, said the water supply issue needed to be addressed.The Department of Energy announced this month that Exxaro's Thabametsi power project was a preferred bidder in its coal-based independent power producer programme.Exxaro says the 557MW plant will be built near Lephalale, adjacent to Grootgeluk.The first phase of Thabametsi would be developed at a cost of about R3-billion to supply nearly fourmillion tons of coal a year."As additional projects come on stream and other demands from population growth manifest, an expansion of water infrastructure will be required," said Mzila Mthenjane, executive head of strategy and stakeholder engagement at Exxaro.But while the Waterberg region is supplying coal for nearby power stations, exporting coal from the area poses greater challenges.Mthenjane said the availability of rail infrastructure was essential for the development of the Waterberg coal field, and the company was working with Transnet Freight Rail so the network could be upgraded to meet long-term demand."Additional to rail infrastructure capacity, affordable rail rates from the Waterberg to both domestic and export markets will be a key enabler of Waterberg coal development," Mthenjane said.But Pr vost said: "Companies are not leaving Mpumalanga; if they did we would be a coalless country and in deep trouble."biyasel@sundaytimes.co.za
