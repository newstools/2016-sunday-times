At the height of the recent black hair kerfuffle at Pretoria High School for Girls, one of my daughters, who also goes to a predominantly white girls-only high school, came home in high dudgeon. "What happened?" asked I."One of the girls used the K-word in my presence.""But," said I almost absentmindedly, "why should that make you angry? You're a Khumalo after all. So, you are a K person?" SA is paying the high cost of discrimination"Nooo, dad, the ugly K-word."Ah, the penny dropped. "You mean kaffir?""You can't use that word. Our teachers say it's an ugly word we shouldn't use.""I don't like the sound of it, darling, but in this house we spell things out properly, don't you remember? It's not the K-word. It is kaffir. You spell it k-a-f-f-i-r. Okay, if you spoke Arabic you would spell it k-a-f-i-r. Same difference. In fact it all started with the Arabs."So I gave her a brief history of the word. How white explorers from Europe who travelled to the Middle East got called kafirs by the Arabs, simply because they were kafirs - as those who do not believe in Allah are called.When the whites came to southern Africa, they found us reluctant to subscribe to their faith, and consequently thought we did not believe in God.What they were forgetting was that their language was different from ours; that we, in our various languages, referred to God as uMvelinqangi, uQamata, Xikwembu, uNkulunkulu - and so on. But all these appellations referred to The Almighty, The Creator, The One Who Was There Before All Of Us. God.Because the interlopers from Europe realised we did not believe in "their" God, they then, in the fashion of those Arabs they'd encountered, decided to call us kaffirs - nonbelievers. Except that what had been a mere descriptor had now become part of the white interlopers' arsenal of racial ideology.The social hierarchy born of this ideology of racism was colour-coded: the white - "civilised" - believers at the top (who enjoyed privileges befitting their status in the hierarchy), and the black, "barbaric", nonbelievers at the bottom. My sense is that many of us melanin-rich people want to keep the word kaffir alive - if only to remind ourselves how far we've come Under this set-up, the word kaffir was no longer an innocuous descriptor, but a bludgeon to denigrate and humiliate people of a certain colour. Even those blacks who had converted to Christianity (in other words "believers") were not immune to being called kaffirs.When my daughter took umbrage at my repeated use of the word she reminded me of many newspaper articles which, in reporting about an Equality Court case where the word kaffir was used, would spell k*****. Preposterous. Dishonest. I've always been curious to know how, if I approached the journalist who wrote the story and asked him to read it out loud to me, he would pronounce k*****. It's such a discombobulating cop-out, this tendency to use k***** when we mean kaffir.I know from experience that the k***** monstrosity is the brainchild of those lovely gatekeepers at newspaper companies - the subeditors. Dear reader, let me take you in on a secret: the world of subeditors is predominantly white - even at newspapers that are supposedly black. Yes, the good old Daily Sun newsroom is awash with white subeditors. One sub (at the Sunday Times) once told me I could not use the word "darkie" in my column. "Why not?" I asked.Why I hire blue eyes before black guys"Because it will upset people," she said."Which people?" We got going for a while, until she realised this darkie wasn't going to back down. So darkie it was. Darkie it still is, when there's a need to use that word.Black people refer to each other as "my darkie". Black people use the word kaffir among themselves often - when someone has unprocessed hair, we call it "kaffir hair". Some black people - especially the older set - even refer to home-brewed beer as "kaffir beer"; not because there's a sense of self-loathing among them, but simply because there is a sense that this word must be kept alive.White people, let me warn you though: I am not encouraging you to go hugging black people and proceed to "I-love-you-my-kaffir", because it will not end well. Just leave the kaffirs to do the kaffiring among themselves. You won't hear me going "hoe gaan dit, my boer?" at a braai that is predominantly white.Even though I know that, at the best of times, the word "boer" simply means "farmer", it evokes certain sentiments among whites when it comes from a black mouth. Even those white friends of mine who are allowed to call me "my darkie" and I refer to them as "kleinbaas or boereseun" know not to use those terms of endearment when we are in the company of black strangers. Because it might not end well. And they know that when the chips are down, this kaffir will play the Pontius Pilate game.My sense is that many of us melanin-rich people want to keep the word kaffir alive - if only to remind ourselves how far we've come. In popular culture - black popular culture, that is - the word kaffir has been used countless times, for countless reasons. Stan Motjuwadi, the late editor of Drum, used to pen his acerbic column under the pen name Dekaffirnated Stan.Arthur Mafokate wrote the highly successful song Kaffir. Mark Mathabane, an Alexandra-born young man who left for the US on a tennis scholarship, wrote a highly successful series of autobiographical books. His first, Kaffir Boy, sold millions in the US, and was followed by Kaffir Boy in America, which spawned Love in Black and White.Racism isn't making a comeback: it never quitI am not advocating the gratuitous use of racist nomenclature, but when we are reporting matters of fact where the word kaffir got used, it's plain silly to seek aegis behind such expressions as "the K-word" or to write the unpronounceable k*****. Who the hell are we fooling? Let our children know how to spell kaffir, so they remember the baggage that word carries.Kaffir was not so long ago an official descriptor of people like me. In fact, many white people still use the word to refer to us (with venomous intent, behind our backs). When they get too angry, they even use it to our faces. But white subeditors say we can't use it in newspapers because it's reprehensible.A friend says this stems from white guilt. Or embarrassment. Why should a decent, contemporary white person - in a democratic, nonracial country - feel guilty for a word she did not create? At any rate, if you insist on feeling guilty, find another way of dealing with it. In dealing with your embarrassment, don't make me complicit in airbrushing my history. Just don't touch me on my kaffir.Khumalo's new book, "#ZuptasMustFall and Other Rants", is now available at book stores
