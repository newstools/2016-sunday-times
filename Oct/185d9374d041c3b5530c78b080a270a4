Garden Day, which is taking place on Sunday, October 9, aims to encourage people to relax in and enjoy their gardens with friends and family.It was originally dreamt up by the gardeners at Babylonstoren, an upmarket lifestyle destination set on a Cape Farm, which is renowned for its magnificent gardens.Whether you've got a huge garden, a tiny patio or balcony, or no garden at all, you can celebrate Garden Day by greening up your home with a few fashionable hanging plants.Babylonstoren shows you how simple it is to make one in this DIY video (step-by-step instructions below).plantYou will need: Plants; we used a plectranthus, but you could also use spekboom, succulents, fig or citrus plants Coconut fibre Hessian fabric Slow-release fertiliser Lots of hessian twine Scissors Pliers A short length of wire Chic DIY: Fashion a cool hanging planter from plastic cupsWhat to do:1) Select a plant.2) Loosen some of the coconut fibre and place it in a bucket, then add some water and mix well. Allow to stand so the coconut fibre can absorb the water.3) Add some slow-release fertiliser to the bucket and mix.4) Cut a square from the hessian fabric.5) Remove the plant from its pot and place it in the middle of the fabric. Then gently loosen the soil around its roots.6) Add some of the coconut fibre mixture and shape it around the roots of the plant.7) Gather the fabric upwards as you fold it around the roots of the plant, creating a rough ball shape. Secure with twine.8) Continue to wrap the twine firmly around the plant, patting it into a compact ball shape as you go, until the fabric is completely covered. Cut the twine and tie the loose end.9) Place the plant in a bucket of water for 10 minutes.10) Meanwhile use the pliers to shape the wire into an S hook.11) Remove the plant from the water and allow it to drain.12) Attach the hook to the twine ball surrounding the plant. Then, use this hook to hang the plant from a length of twine.NOTE: To water your plant, soak it in a bucket of water.
