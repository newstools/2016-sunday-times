Yet this Mampara sees no potential conflict in attending a meeting at Luthuli House with cabinet ministers and the very man he may one day have to charge on more than 700 counts of corruption, fraud and money-laundering.Abrahams always cries foul over accusations that he is not his own man . But his actions since taking office, including charging Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan with fraud and then practically begging him to give him reasons to drop the charges, persuade us that we have a Mampara for a chief prosecutor.
