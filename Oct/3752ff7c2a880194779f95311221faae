She joined the Afro-pop group at 17, never dreaming she would still be there three decades on.Now, following a seven-year hiatus, Mango Groove is set to release an album this month."This album was four years in the making and it really was a labour of love," Johnston said."It was an emotional time for all of us. I had lost my mom during that time but we learnt and grew from that sorrow."What started as a tribute to some of their favourite South African artists developed into a double-disc album with old and new songs.The 24-track album, Faces to the Sun, has powerful renditions of classics such as Mmalo We, Malaika, The Lion Sleeps Tonight, Kinders van Die Wind, Vulindlela and Another Country.The songs feature Rebecca Malope, Vusi Mahlasela, Juanita du Plessis, Zolani Mahola from Freshly Ground, Kurt Darren, vocal quartet Romanz and Mo-T from Mi Casa, among others.The first disc, titled Memories and Moments, is about honouring music and artists from the past. The second disc, Here, Now and Forever, is Mango Groove's re-entrance and declaration of where they are heading.For Johnston, there was no temptation to conform to current popular sounds. "We need to sound like Mango Groove, otherwise what's the point?"But while the balance between remaining authentic yet sounding fresh was tricky, navigating their way in an oversaturated market will be their priority."The music industry is such a gamble, you just don't know. A lot has changed, and the online component is growing, that's all brand new for us. But the industry itself is fairly healthy."Johnston said she was humbled to see young people enjoying hits like Hellfire, Dance Some More, Moments Away and Special Star.The band's most recent performance was at Rocking the Daisies music festival in Darling, Western Cape, last weekend, where they were an "11-piece travelling circus".Their unique blend of marabi, kwela and pop has secured the group 12 No1 hits, multiple music and video awards and multiple sold-out shows at the Sun City Superbowl and Standard Bank Arena.
