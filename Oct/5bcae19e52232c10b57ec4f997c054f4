The South African, fourth in this race at the Rio Olympics, led from the start and never looked like being caught by Daiya Seto of Japan, his conqueror at the Doha, Singapore and Tokyo legs.Le Clos touched in 1min 49.95sec, more than two seconds quicker than his rival in 1:52.38, but slower than his times from early in the series.It was probably a case of Seto being more fatigued than Le Clos being speedy, especially after the Japanese's busy schedule at the previous World Cup gala in front of home fans earlier in the week.Even so, the bearded Le Clos should be heartened being back atop the podium as the countdown starts to the world short-course championships in Canada in December.As erratic as he has been in the longer race, Le Clos has been electric in the two shorter races.Yesterday he won the 50m 'fly, his underwater out of the turn giving him the edge as he made it nine wins out of the nine World Cup events this season.He'll look to do the same in the 100m 'fly in the final session today and take his total butterfly win count for the series to 24 out of 27.Veteran Roland Schoeman, the only other South African in action, took silver behind Le Clos in the 50m 'fly and bronze in the 50m breaststroke behind Brazilian Felipe Lima and Vladimir Morozov of Russia.Morozov will secure the $100,000 cheque as the top male swimmer of the series - Le Clos, a three-time winner, is second - and Hungarian Katinka Hosszu is the top female swimmer of the World Cup.
