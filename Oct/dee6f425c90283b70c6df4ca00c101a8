World Class, the brand behind the globe s biggest bartending competition, are going on a quest that spans five countries to create the ultimate drinks list. As is the way with grand adventures in the modern era, the whole thing will be filmed as part of a new travel show called World Class List. The only thing they are missing is a presenter. Kamini Pather trumps 'Top Billing' for local TV awardCombining food, drink and travel, the show is set to be an immersive experience of global cuisine and cocktail culture. Whoever gets the gig will get the opportunity to explore hidden gems in some of the world s most exotic locations accompanied by some of the best bartenders in the world. We recognise that World Class bartenders don t just create the most amazing drinks - they are an in-the-know community who can also serve up the best experiences a city has to offer. Together we want the host and bartenders to explore, create and share with the world their list of the top drinks with the world, says Johanna Dalley, World Class Global Director.The competition closes on October 21.
