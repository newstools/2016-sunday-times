So deep was the pain of losing their only child that Wickham and his wife, Michelle, moved to Johannesburg a few months later to escape the memories.Four years earlier they had quit their jobs overseas and returned to South Africa so that Cole could "complete his schooling locally and establish a network of friends".Wickham's wounds were reopened this week when the Constitutional Court denied him leave to appeal against a judgment of the High Court in Cape Town which prevented him from having a say in the criminal prosecution of Annika Slabbert, the driver of the car in which his son was killed. Crooked cop flossed out Cop admitted to hospital after his arrest in 'blackmail' case"The situation [Wickham] finds himself in commands our sympathy and respect," the Constitutional Court said in its ruling."We endorse the High Court's observation that the magistrate of the trial court could have exercised some degree of judicial maturity, civility and empathy to allow Mr Wickham latitude to express his feelings at having lost his son."Cole was in his first week of a business studies degree at Stellenbosch University when he died on the evening of February 10 2012.According to his father, Cole and his friends were travelling in Slabbert's small hatchback when she crashed into a stationary vehicle. Cole and the driver of that vehicle died.Wickham hired two accident reconstruction experts who concluded that Slabbert, 21 at the time, had been driving at between 147km/h and 155km/h in an 80km/h zone. She had been drinking and there were six people in the car, including one on the lap of the passenger in the front seat.Slabbert, who was charged with two counts of culpable homicide, entered into a plea and sentencing agreement with the prosecution which the Stellenbosch Magistrate's Court approved.She was sentenced to 18 months' correctional supervision and a R10,000 fine. Wickham challenged the decision, culminating in Tuesday's ruling."The Constitutional Court ruling effectively allows the National Prosecuting Authority and the courts to continue to disregard victims and deny them a say in criminal proceedings," said Wickham. Christmas in Mauritian jail after island tragedy"We viewed the magistrate's court hearing as a farce, with the defence attorney and the public prosecutor ignoring our presence, sharing jokes and having meetings with the magistrate in chambers before the case was heard."Our attempts to make a victim impact statement were strenuously objected to by the defence attorney and prosecutor. The magistrate did not use his discretion in hearing us."Wickham said Slabbert had "without remorse nor regard for the carnage and devastation she had caused, posted pictures [on Facebook] of her partying and her new car".The NPA said the Service Charter for Victims of Crime in South Africa did not guarantee rights to participate in proceedings."Mr Wickham has succeeded in raising the voices of victims of crime. It is unfortunate that he did not achieve the result he wants," it said.Criminal law expert William Booth said the charter was a means for victims to express their opinions and seek justice. It did not entitle victims to dictate to the prosecution.
