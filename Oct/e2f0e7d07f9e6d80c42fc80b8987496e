The US elections, a few days away, are testament to the fact that these are abnormal times. The absurd decision of the British to divorce themselves from the EU, without an economic plan outside the family, is another example.The tectonic shifts across the Atlantic and in the UK can be best explained by slowing growth set against a backdrop of the nationalistic frustrations of those left behind by globalisation, which has brought rising immigration and increasing mechanisation.Underlying South Africa's tensions there's perhaps some shared experience. Is South Africa approaching banana republic status?The wheels of our economy began to creak close to a decade ago, in line with a global slowdown. There was always an expiration date to the stimulus actions followed by the National Treasury after 2008 to boost growth.A counter-cyclical policy led to an explosion in public sector jobs and a boom time for the country's major retailers, buoyed by the buying power offered by unsecured lending.While Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and his team are now visibly tightening their belts, in truth it's been under way for a few seasons. The playbook they are following is similar to that of former minister Nhlanhla Nene.Now, I'll be the first to admit that performing well under such conditions would prove difficult for even the most popular of presidents.But here's the difference between good leadership and not-so-good leadership, the latter an understatement about the incumbent - President Jacob Zuma.Under such strenuous economic conditions, good leadership would automatically call for a concerted effort in building confidence.On campaign trails, US presidential candidates of old used to strut on to the stage with shirt sleeves rolled up to show the electorate a candidate hard at work for them.On this country's political stage we've had a president who has done everything but show that he's working for the national cause.Before December 9 last year it was a show that could be uncomfortably stomached. Until that moment it didn't quite feel as threatening to our long-term prospects. Until that fateful day, when a competent, black finance minister, Nene, was fired, it seemed that we'd just have to live through a few more years of an increasingly unpopular and aloof president. One man's tantrums dare not spoil it for SAThe play for state coffers raised suspicion of there being a much bigger conspiracy at play.From that moment, the fact that water still runs from taps, that the lights are on, that schools are being built or that tertiary fees are not being increased for those who can least afford them, has not been enough.If he could do so before, the president can no longer lead his country out of the crisis of confidence in both him and the government he leads.At this stage, whether Zuma reshuffles his cabinet and fires his finance minister or chooses a more sane path, it doesn't matter to the national psyche.His is a leadership that is spent and the longer he holds office, the more he threatens the rule of his party.We often argue over what we are witnessing: a strong presidency or a very insecure one in its last mile.We are in the insecure stage, often its most brutal to its enemies. But a wounded soldier can rise even stronger, which the president knows all too well.E-mail derbyr@sundaytimes.co.za or find him on Twitter @ronderby
