Where other departments, agencies and state-owned enterprises have been hobbled by corruption, mismanagement, political interference and the now-customary musical chairs of acting heads, SARS has excelled, gaining a reputation for efficiency and raking in billions of rands for the state and, hopefully, for the good of all South Africans. But this could be changing.The bizarre "kidnap" that played itself out at the SARS offices in Pretoria this week is but the latest in a series of disturbing events that suggest all is not well.Evidently the Hawks, who are fast gaining a reputation as President Jacob Zuma's personal police force, did not get his message in parliament this week that he did not want South Africa to become a "banana republic".The main players in the SARS hostage drama videoIn the same week, Hawks heavies are accused of "kidnapping" SARS lawyer Vlok Symington in a ham-handed attempt to get their hands on an affidavit that essentially shows that Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan acted in good faith when he approved a pension payout for SARS deputy commissioner Ivan Pillay.The incident, and the part allegedly played by SARS commissioner Tom Moyane, will have rattled taxpayers.It follows disturbing claims that Jonas Makwakwa, chief officer for business and individual taxes at the tax agency, not only secured a job for his girlfriend there, but that suspicious payments totalling R1.7-million were made into his bank account with her apparent assistance.Makwakwa has been suspended pending an investigation, but we don't have Moyane to thank for this: instead it seems he sat on the information, acting only once it was in the public domain.Moyane, who is known to be close to Zuma, has already clashed with Gordhan over his move to restructure SARS earlier this year, and it is also worrying that his bodyguard seems to have played a central role in the kidnap drama.Add that to revelations that Moyane's nephew scored a debt-collection contract with SARS worth about R220-million, and one starts to wonder if the national plague of dysfunctionality is now settling over SARS too. Hawks already investigating SARS pair SARS Moyane answers Corruption Watch s claimsOf course, the troubles at the revenue service could not have come at a worse time for the economy, which is mired in a low-growth trap that threatens to derail the whole post-1994 reconstruction and development project.If there was ever a time that SARS needed to be lean, mean and beyond suspicion of corruption, nepotism and mismanagement, it is now.In his medium-term budget this week, Gordhan put taxpayers on notice that he expects them to pay billions more in the coming years, even as he slashes government spending and appeals, in vain one suspects, for state departments to keep staff numbers down.Many taxpayers, who are already asking whether their hard-earned tax rands are not pouring into a bottomless pit of wastage, misspending and theft, must be having second thoughts. Tax morality is on the line here.Of course, tax is obligatory, but expect a redoubling of efforts at evasion. And if, as some suspect will be the case, the government is forced to raise the rate of VAT, it won't only be sedate middle-class taxpayers who will demur.SARS needs to be fighting fit in the years ahead, but that is not what we are seeing now.
