The 400,000km of semi-desert in the heart of the country has the most diverse tortoise population in the world.But now they are "vulnerable to extinction" in a fast-changing habitat.Earlier this year, a national study by the Endangered Wildlife Trust found that wildlife ranching was on the rise, bringing with it an increase in fencing.Humans eating wild mammals into extinction: studyAnother study, by Andrew Beck at the University of the Witwatersrand, found that electric fences were gaining popularity not just among game ranch owners, but livestock farmers too.Beck found that 10 species of reptile were being killed by electric fencing, and 90% of them were tortoises.A survey on a farm near Graaff-Reinet found 14 dead tortoises in a single morning along 10km of fencing, and an earlier survey found that 52 tortoises had died over a short space of time along 8.4km of electric fencing in the Thomas Baines Nature Reserve."When tortoises come into contact with an electrified strand they usually react by retracting the head and limbs into the shell and thus remain a part of the circuit, receiving regular shocks, which ultimately results in death," Beck explained.Some of them urinate out of fear, allowing even more current to pass through their bodies.All three studies found that raising the lowest strands of the fences - currently 20cm from the ground - would stop them from being a death trap for tortoises and other small animals.Steve Smith, a conservationist with a special interest in the Karoo, said "no changes in design or regulations" had been implemented despite the findings.He described the many dead tortoises he had come across in the area.</img>Studies have found that raising the lowest strands of the fences - currently 20cm from the ground - would stop tortoises from being caught in a death traps.

Electric fences are used to keep damage-causing animals out," she said.The organisation was aware of the fact that "some reptilian species and other small animals like tortoises might suffer as a consequence of fencing [that has been] strung too low".But biodiversity on game ranches was rich, and the industry view was that "the overall contribution of private game ranching, which would obviously necessitate some form of fencing, far outweighs the negative consequences that results from fencing".Kitshoff-Botha said the organisation was drafting a code of best practice for electric fencing.farbert@sundaytimes.co.za
