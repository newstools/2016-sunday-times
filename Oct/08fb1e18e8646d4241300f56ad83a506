They are Kaizer Chiefs, the black-and-gold boys who have been sans the glamour. In recent times their glory has been replaced by gory.For the whole of last season Amakhosi stood on the opposite end of the football aristocracy of the local game where they fancy themselves to be.The script didn't change when the 2016-17 campaign began.Almost without exception, they've huffed and puffed and loitered on the pitch with no intent of improving after a poor season.Unplugged: Sauce for the goose (Pirates) not same as sauce for gander (Sundowns)Fears of more misery among the faithful strengthened with the 1-0 defeat by Cape Town City in the opening game.The fires of worry escalated to an inferno when that setback was followed by the MTN8 first-round elimination, courtesy of crafty Bidvest Wits.The descent was arrested by a 1-1 draw with Platinum Stars.It was a draw that almost never was. A thunderous shot from Stars' Robert Ngambiricocheted against the crossbar and didn't cross the line.Since then Steve Komphela's men have dragged themselves kicking and screaming from the unrecognisable mess they've become mired in.A victory at Makhulong Stadium against Highlands Park offset the promoted club's upward mobility and reminded Chiefs of the long lost sweet scent of victory.A familiar foe in the form of Maritzburg United, the club Komphela left for Chiefs, surfaced at FNB Stadium.The men from the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands were dispatched 2-0.Up next for Komphela and his team was a trip to a Free State Stars in free fall - another outfit he had previously called home.The Zimbabwean connection of Willard Katsande and new boy Mitchell Katsvairo got the goals as Chiefs completed a hat-trick of wins, an occurrence that had become as rare as the sighting of unidentified flying objects.Look at the log table. See who are the leaders. At the top they may be, but Komphela will be the first to admit that they are more a work in progress than the finished article.He must be mindful that although they may appear to be getting acquainted with the feeling of winning, it has been anything but pretty.The golden thread in all three victories was that they were achieved devoid of any flair, fluidity and panache that had been the signature of successful sides of days gone by. There is a section of supporters who share a theory that when he is happily in love, Khune's game suffers In terms of a set of principles concerned with the nature and appreciation of beauty, Chiefs have been off the mark.But show me anyone who can find a column on the log that awards three points for beautiful football and I will show you someone who has a conflicting relationship with the truth.It looks like Komphela is mirroring Chiefs in his own image.He has accepted that Chiefs can start matches without the tried and tested - some might even argue tired and tested - Siphiwe Tshabalala, Tshepo Masilela and Bernard Parker without the sky falling in.Masilela has served the club stupendously. His credentials speak for themselves.But a younger, energetic and highly competitive Sibusiso Khumalo was not brought in to be an ornament on the bench.It is not to say that Masilela has become rubbish overnight, but healthy competition is welcome on any day.Likewise Tshabalala. If George Lebese is doing fine, and has to keep Shabba on the sidelines, so be it. Manyonga is my man, on any given SundayIf Katsvairo must play ahead of Parker, so be it.It leaves no room for complacency and keeps everyone on their toes.The return of Mulomowandou Mathoho from injury to resume his central rearguard partnership with Lorenzo Gordinho has shored up the heart of defence.With Ramahlwe Mphahlele completing the back four, the quartet has enjoyed the benefit of playing together for two back-to-back games.Behind the foursome is Itumeleng Khune. There is a section of supporters who share a theory that when he is happily in love, Khune's game suffers.Those fans will have their fingers crossed that Cupid has not connected their captain to the lady into whose ear he was seen whispering sweet nothings live on television while on Bafana Bafana duty.In fact, Komphela is settling into a starting XI he hopes is getting into its stride - the same troops who trotted onto the pitch against Highlands Park are the same as those who took on Free State Stars.There is no guarantee that a similar lineup will stand in their next fixture when Chiefs host Ajax Cape Town at the Moses Mabhida Stadium on October 15.It will be when they visit Orlando Pirates at FNB Stadium on October 29 that they will really show whether they have turned the corner and regained their mojo.Convincing? Not a fat chance. Enterprising? Far from it. But at least Komphela is getting the points. Frankly, that's all that matters, for now.Twitter: @bbkunplugged99
