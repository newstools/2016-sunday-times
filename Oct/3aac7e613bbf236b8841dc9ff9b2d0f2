Mervyn Dirks, an MP from KwaZulu-Natal, was shouted down by almost the entire ANC caucus at a meeting held behind closed doors on Thursday, when he proposed that Mthembu's views on the ANC leadership be added to the agenda.This comes as party structures supporting Zuma, including the ANC Youth League and the Umkhonto weSizwe Military Veterans' Association, are calling for Mthembu's removal as chief whip following his statements.Party MPs said that in motivating his proposed agenda item to the meeting of ANC parliamentarians, Dirks told caucus chairman Seiso Mohai that Mthembu had recently been making pronouncements against the leadership of the ANC and that the caucus should express a view on his conduct.Do we still have leaders who can save the ANC from itself?But Mohai rejected the proposal, and told Dirks that the discussion belonged in the NEC and the national working committee of the ANC.Insiders say ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe, who was present at the meeting, supported Mohai in dismissing Dirks's proposal.However, a determined Dirks tried to push the matter further, only for him to be shouted down and heckled by MPs who told him he was out of order to insist on forcing a change in the agenda when the chairman of the caucus had ruled on the matter.An MP who was at the meeting said: "There was someone who tried to raise that and he was told 'voetsek' [get lost], that won't happen. Leave the chief whip alone. From a caucus point of view, look, we are not involved practically."We would be naive to involve ourselves in something that is the ambit of the NEC. He is talking about his own NEC that he serves on. Where do we [as the caucus] get involved?"Another MP said the discussion was quashed after Mantashe intervened."We didn't get ourselves involved in the [Mthembu matter]. Mantashe said he's attending to this thing. It's an NEC problem."But there's no backlash for Mthembu. Their timing would be incorrect from an experience point of view."One caucus member said the dramatic exchange did not last long.He said the caucus discussed the medium-term budget statement delivered by Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan.Mthembu said on Friday that he had nothing to say on the matter. Gordhan cabinet mates to talk nuclear on court date"Caucus dealt with that issue properly and there's nothing more to add," he said.Mantashe said he was not in the caucus and couldn't comment on the discussion. He confirmed however that the matter was being attended to by the ANC leadership."Yes, we are dealing with the matter," he said.Dirks was not available for comment at the time of going to press.Although this might appear to be a victory for Mthembu, insiders say his detractors retreated because they realised that Mthembu enjoyed the support of the majority in the caucus.Mthembu's opponents are said to be plotting to raise the matter at the next national executive meeting.Mthembu last week called for the entire NEC to resign for failing to provide the party with proper leadership.He was attacked by pro-Zuma senior ANC members at a meeting of the NWC last Monday after he expressed support for Gordhan.This followed the National Prosecuting Authority's decision to charge Gordhan with fraud related to the payment of an early retirement benefit of R1.1-million to former South African Revenue Service deputy commissioner Ivan Pillay, who was later rehired on a contract.
