To achieve all this and further bolster the experience in his team, Coetzee has recalled experienced France-based tighthead Janniedu Plessis and wing JP Pietersen from Japan, while the Lions' Ruan Combrinck returns from injury.He will again heavily rely on the players that did duty in the disastrous Rugby Championship, but out of necessity had to select 12 uncapped players who have to do duty against the Barbarians at Wembley next month.The match falls outside the international test window and therefore Coetzee could not select his foreign-based players. Sergeal, Venter, Jean-Luc and Smit rewarded with Bok call-upsFour players, Roelof Smit, Jean-Luc du Preez, Sergeal Petersen and Francois Venter, who have been selected to play against the Barbarians, will remain with the Springbok squad for the tests against England, Italy and Wales.Francois Hougaard and Juan de Jongh are injured and were not considered, while Toulon eighthman Duane Vermeulen's conditioning was deemed below international standard.Rugby followers on either side of the Vaal River will be enthused by the news that Lions centre Rohan Janse van Rensburg and Western Province fullback Cheslin Kolbe have been included in the squad to play the Baabaas.Janse van Rensburg was one of the form players in Super Rugby but his star has somewhat faded in the Currie Cup.
