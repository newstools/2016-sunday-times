Try Marco's tips: Ditch the wooden spoon in favour of a spatula. A spatula brings everything down from the side of the pan and also gets right into the edges. One of the biggest mistakes people make when cooking risotto is not putting enough stock in at a time. If your rice isn't submerged in stock, it'll cook inconsistently. When finishing off a risotto, ensure the Parmesan cheese is finely grated and the butter is soft so that they'll melt easily. Rather than stirring these ingredients into the pan straight away, let them sit on top of the risotto for a minute until they're melted.4) Be generous when you salt fishSome of the seasoning will wash off in the pan, said Marco to the contestants during a pressure test.5) Add a little salt when crushing garlicOnce you've chopped your garlic, add a little salt and crush it using the flat side of your knife.
