Prepare to be astounded. Mohammed Moorad, or Mo Magic, is the country's leading young magician and he is in Joburg for a limited run this weekend before he disappears back to Durban for the festive season.Following his prime time TV series, Magic with Mo, the magician's theatre production has been sold out around the country, and now we know why - his magic tricks are a mix of mentalism, comedy and "effects".The 90-minute show is a fun night out for the whole family (ages 6 and up). I was left open-mouthed by his card tricks, mentalism with numbers and disappearing acts (including one involving fine jewellery that left the audience breathless). Mo Magic is on at The Fringe at Joburg Theatre until Sunday October 23. Book your tickets online.Mo Magic Mo
