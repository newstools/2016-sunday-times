The spectators at the Lucas Moripe Stadium have been increasing noticeably with each match since April, when it became evident that Mamelodi Sundowns would win the league title, and they have progressed to the Caf Champions League.Yesterday's first leg of the final against Zamalek of Egypt brought arguably a bigger crowd than when Kaizer Chiefs visited in the last month of last season.This despite the intense heat as Sundowns switched the kickoff time from the 7pm they have preferred throughout the campaign to 3pm, presumably hoping a combination of the baking sun and altitude would tire their opponents.Getting to the venue is not easy either, with little or no parking, leaving thousands to trek down Maunde Drive, where the jacaranda trees in full purple bloom provided some cover.As a result there was a steady trickle into the venue, even after half time before the venue was officially at its 40 000-capacity.But the supporters kept coming, rewarded by a vintage performance that underlined Sundowns' status as favourites to win their first continental title.Atteridgeville isn't exactly a glamour football destination and the austere concrete of the stadium usually does little to engender the feeling of a special day out, but that was not true of an afternoon of unbridled joy for the locals.The play was fast and furious, the singing raucous and the result put all South Africa in dreamland, albeit with 90 minutes still to go.Except for the 100-odd Egyptians fans who arrived at the same time as their team.Almost to a man they were holding up their phone cameras and filming the opposing fans, who gave them a relatively warm welcome.It was too hot for aggression anyway.They all tried to get into the VIP area, pushing and shoving at the narrow entrance where one fell and cut his head as several women in the group burst into tears.Sundowns' security were slow in anticipating the problem but eventually herded some into a reserved section on the far side while the rest stayed in the VIP section, draping large Egyptian flags right over the tunnel and turning the main part of the grandstand into a Zamalek zone. But they were removed before kickoff.Not that it bothered the home fans. They were too busy dancing and rapping along with Mtee and Cassper Nyovest, who bounced up and down the athletics track that separates the crowd from the field.Zamalek even got a chance at the turntable, with a few bars from a popular song, Misr, which means Egypt, belted out by the MC.Two Zamalek officials, sweating in their dark suits, then ran round the track with their country's flag. They had stopped to walking pace at the 250m mark.Note to any travelling Sundowns supporters for next Sunday's second leg: it would probably not be advisable to try that with the South African flag at Alexandria's Borg El Arab Stadium. The reaction is likely to be a lot different to the bemusement shown by the home support.But those who can, should make the trip.Because Sundowns are so close now to crowning a historic night for sport in this country.
