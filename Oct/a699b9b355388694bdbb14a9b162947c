"So I make shoes with a high heel shaped like stuck chewing gum."The result is a stylish black-and-white sneaker with an 11-centimetre (four-inch) pink dripping heel so realistic it could be mistaken for real gum.The bizarre creation, which sells for about R31,415 ($2,240 or 1,949 euros) a pair, caught the imagination of actress Whoopi Goldberg, who wore them when she appeared with US President Barack Obama on talk show The View in 2012.American singer Fergie wore a pair of the same shoes in the video for her song M.I.L.F. $.GOING GAGAThe bulk of Levi's orders come through his website but one, in 2011, changed the course of his career - propelling his shoes onto the global pop scene."I got an email from a fashion design studio that deals with Lady Gaga.

Akerlund, who designs for the likes of Beyonce and Kim Kardashian, has put 13 of the Israeli's designs in her showroom.Goldberg has been a keen admirer for years, sporting a pair of his low heels shaped like a banana skin at the Paris premiere of the Sister Act stage show in 2012.The same year, Vogue Italia described Levi as "a genius, unusual, true creative talent, the captor of surrounding reality, of unpredictable objects, of animal appearances".MADONNA NEXT?Among his many creations are shoes shaped like playground slides, stretching cats and even a design with a miniature harp in the heel."Everything starts with a fantasy, then it becomes a challenge," he says."You have to find technical solutions. I go through phases where I think I'm crazy, that it's impossible, then I'm afraid that in a second everything could tear or break.""Then suddenly it starts to look like the original sketches and then I get the heady feeling of having given life to a fantasy."</img>'Blonde Ambition' heels designed by Kobi Levi.
