Roger Quan, 44, a bank employee, spends his Sunday afternoons seated among the live studio audience at one of the biggest talent search shows in the country."I endeavour to go to all the shows. The one time I didn't go this season was when I went to a wedding. On a Sunday I volunteer at a rehabilitation centre. At 3.30pm they know I have to leave for the Idols show," said Quan.Prior to 2009 he used to watch the shows "here and there", he said. "One day a colleague asked me if I would like to attend a live show and that sparked the interest."He said the first time he was mentioned on air was when season five runner-up Graeme Watkins said during an Idols insert something about being motivated by the support from his fans and "the Asian dude in the golden circle"."That's how I got known a bit. I then asked M-Net for tickets and have been requesting them ever since, almost every week."I feel young and carefree in the golden circle. It has connected me to a lot of people, like other supporters. Being part of the audience electrifies me. I like the fact that there are no other Asian fans in the crowd. I am hopeful for each singer," said Quan.He himself could not sing, he said. "I like to support and give a bit of push. I think South Africa has a lot of talent."Quan still supports former Idols entrants Lloyd Cele, Shekhinah Donnell, Kyle Deutsch and Daniel Baron when they perform.He is also in an Idols group formed in 2009 to support Watkins. "We are all in contact with each other on WhatsApp and try to get together once a year to talk about Idols and life in general."Quan digs Idols judge Somizi Mhlongo. "He is who he is. He adds freshness to Idols and comes up with his own dictionary of words that the crowd latches onto."Quan said this year's contestants who had caught his eye were Keegan Martin and Terra Kocks.
