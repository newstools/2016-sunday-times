Why did you think KENZO was the right brand to partner with now, and what makes them different from previous collaborations? We've had KENZO on our wish list ever since Carol and Humberto took over. We love what they've done with the brand's heritage. Last year, the Balmain was blingy and glamorous and eccentric; Kenzo is more street and about individuality.Challenges you faced working on this collection? Recreating the ribbon dress was a challenge, but it turned out really well.Re-making history with the new KENZO x H&M collectionHow do you know what customers are going to respond to? You never really know what pieces will be flying off the racks. Standout pieces like the ribbon dresses are usually what people go for, but also more of the basics; easy to wear pieces like T-shirts and sweatshirts. I'm sure the pink tiger print boots will be popular because everyone loves a fancy shoe.How have the collections expanded over the years? When we started with the Karl Lagerfeld collection, we never thought we would continue for so many years. Now 12 years later, here we are . That collection was much smaller because it was the first one. We have developed and know what our customers like to buy. It's nice to have added more accessories, for example. It also depends on who we collaborate with, what their special things are, what they want in the collection.Hints on who the next design collaboration will be with? It depends on whether our customers like these collaborations, and also on who wants to collaborate with us. Hopefully, there are still designers who want to work with H&amp;M. It is very inspiring; it gives a lot to the designers and we learn from each other.
