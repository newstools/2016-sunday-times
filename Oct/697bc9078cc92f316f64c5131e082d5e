The DA politician will tie the knot with Janine Handley, 47, in the tiny Eastern Cape town of Kasouga next Saturday."I'm very excited ... and not nervous at all," the groom said yesterday.Trollip said it was "love at first sight" when they met at the home of mutual friends about three years ago.He had just gone through a divorce, and Handley's husband had died a year earlier from cancer."Neither of us was really ready for a relationship. I was bruised and Janine was still in mourning."But within five weeks the couple - who both have two children from their previous marriages - started dating. "We have been inseparable since."The guest list includes DA leader Mmusi Maimane and party members Tony Leon and John Steenhuisen. However, Maimane's predecessor, Helen Zille, has apparently not been invited.
