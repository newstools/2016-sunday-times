The Japanese brewer previously bought the Peroni, Grolsch and Meantime brands from the world's top brewer Anheuser-Busch (AB) InBev, as it aims to solidify its footing in Europe.The news comes as Belgium-based AB InBev is to buyout Britain's SABMiller, in a blockbuster deal which will see AB InBev become the beer industry's global leader.As part of the deal, the EU has demanded the brewer divest SABMiller's business in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia. Cheers to a piece of history as AB InBev swallows SABAB InBev was also forced to release its Italian, Dutch and UK lineup to ease competition concerns and win approval from regulators.The Nikkei newspaper said AB InBev plans to open bidding for the British brewer's East European operations shortly after the Monday completion of the deal.SABMiller enjoys the largest market share in all of the countries apart from Slovakia, where it comes in at the second, the Nikkei said.The company's portfolio includes the popular Czech brand Pilsner Urquell.If Asahi's 500 billion yen bid is successful, it would be the biggest-ever beer market acquisition by a Japanese brewer, the Nikkei said.But Asahi issued a qualified denial of the Nikkei report, saying: "Currently, the company has no policy on such a buyout plan or offering."
