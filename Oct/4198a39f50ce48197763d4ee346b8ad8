Unfortunately, in South Africa we cannot say we enjoy the benefits of a fearless and independent prosecuting authority that discharges its professional duties and mandate without any political meddling.Shaun Abrahams, head of the National Prosecuting Authority , has spent the past two weeks trying to convince South Africans that there was no political interference in his decision to bring charges of fraud against Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan.In fact, he has been on a similar mission since he took over from Mxolisi Nxasana as national director of public prosecutions last year - fending off those labelling him President Jacob Zuma's political lackey and an official who is incapable of operating within the confines of the law.He was not helped by his decision to appeal a high court ruling overturning a 2009 decision by the NPA to withdraw 783 charges of fraud, corruption and money laundering against Zuma before he became president.After the High Court in Pretoria ruled that the decision by the NPA not to continue with the charges had been irrational, Abrahams sought to appeal to the Constitutional Court.Abrahams met Zuma and three ministers before move to charge GordhanThat court ruled that it would not hear the matter before a decision had been made by the Supreme Court of Appeal .The high court ruling was a blow for Abrahams as it confirmed what many had long suspected; our revelation today will further strengthen the belief that he is being used as a pawn in a political chess game.We report elsewhere in this newspaper that Abrahams held a meeting with Zuma and senior party leaders at the ANC's headquarters, Luthuli House, just 24 hours before announcing his decision to charge Gordhan.According to Zuma's and Abrahams' offices, the meeting was convened to discuss the violent protests by university students.If that is the case, questions must be asked about why such an important meeting took place at Luthuli House and not the Union Buildings.Why were the ministers of higher education and police not invited to the meeting, if it had been called to discuss ways to restore law and order in our higher education institutions?Most importantly, what role did Minister of Social Development Bathabile Dlamini - one of Gordhan's fiercest critics - play in the meeting?This lack of separation between politics and prosecutions is exactly what makes South Africans of all walks of life question the independence of the NPA.Unless these questions and many others are answered, South Africans - who have for years been crying for a fair, professional and independent NPA that is free of political meddling - will remain justified in feeling that prosecutorial decisions in this country are influenced by politics.Perhaps part of the problem is the ambiguity of our constitution when it pronounces on the independence of South Africa's prosecutorial authority.While the constitution is clear that the prosecuting authority must execute its mandate without fear, favour or prejudice, it also gives the minister of justice final responsibility over the prosecuting authority.
