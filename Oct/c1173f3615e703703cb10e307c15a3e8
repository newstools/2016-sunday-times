Luxury label Missibaba has opened a new store on Rosebank's trendy Keyes Art Mile. Originally pitted as a storage unit, Missibaba decided to tackle the shop-fitting project hands-on and did not use architects or interior designers to bring their new space to life. The result is one incredible sensory explosion. A gold vinyl panel leads to the entrance, pulling customers through the double-volume glass stack doors.Once inside, it's a brightly coloured space filled with delectable accessories. To commemorate the occasion, the brand created a bevy of beautiful clutches. "We are very excited to unveil our new space and we look forward to introducing many capsule collections that express the joy of making," says co-owner Lizel Strydom.The quirky aesthetics that define the Amsterdam roots of Scotch &amp; Soda have been given a sublime new showcase. Their newest store has opened in Joburg's Hyde Park Corner to the delight of regular customers who revel in the brand's fun interpretations.We love this season's boho florals and sports luxe casuals in great fabrics and brilliant cuts. We're eyeing a smiling banana T-shirt in the cleverly designed window display. The store feels like a little bit of Amsterdam cool has set up camp in our own Hyde Park Corner.
