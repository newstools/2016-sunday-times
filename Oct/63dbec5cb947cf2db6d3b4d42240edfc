1) ZANA PRODUCTSFrom furniture to accessories, these product and textile designers have a playful aesthetic that ll liven up any home. I particularly love Zana Products's new bed linen range. And starting at just R699 for a duvet set, they aren t going to break the bank either.2) RIALHEIMWith ceramics, lighting, textiles and more, Rialheim has an amazing range of products to bring a bit of whimsy into your home. Because after all, why shouldn t your table platter boast a 3D dinosaur?
