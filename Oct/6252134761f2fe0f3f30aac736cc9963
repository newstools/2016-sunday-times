The left-arm wrist-spinning and orthodox duo were third and seventh in the provincial franchise rankings with 41 wickets at 19.97 and 36 wickets at 32.00 respectively.While Maharaj played in a Dolphins side that flattered to deceive, Shamsi was at the forefront of a Titans unit that won six out of 10 matches to win the Sunfoil Series.That the discarded Dane Piedt (Cape Cobras) and Simon Harmer (Warriors) also featured in the top 10 speaks volumes of how spin has become a central theme in franchise cricket.In a country where anything other than orthodox is frowned upon, Shamsi is a rare cause that needs to be celebrated.Having stuck to his guns and persisted with left-arm chinaman instead of being straight-jacketed as an orthodox tweaker, Shamsi knows the path less trodden is a way of life for him."One of my coaches said I should just become an offspinner when I wanted to bowl chinaman. I asked why and I was told that this craft is difficult and normal finger spin is easier," Shamsi said."I don't know whether it was a moment of madness or inner determination from me but I didn't want to take the easier route. As I look back now, I'm actually glad that I didn't."I suppose I like things to be difficult because when I quit fast bowling when I entered high school, I was given the easier option of orthodox spin."I guess you always ask yourself whether you want to do things that are done by other people or do you want to try something that works for you. That tough option was a good one."All the resilience collected by the 26-year-old from Johannesburg will be a necessity in Australia.Travelling spinners are often devoured on the unhelpful surfaces and Australia's expected aggression in any first test of any series often knocks the stuffing out of them.Shamsi travelled with South Africa "A" to Australia recently so he has an idea of what to expect but the importance of what he and Maharaj have achieved is not lost on him."I played with Keshav when I was at the Dolphins and he's a wonderful bowler. He's done very well and deserves his call-up. He's an example of a player who has worked hard and made the most of the opportunity that has come his way. At least players know now that first-class players know their hard work will be rewarded," Shamsi said."Having been in Australia with SA "A", I know the pitches don't turn so I know I had to keep on working hard and doing my best for the team."
