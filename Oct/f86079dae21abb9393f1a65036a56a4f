"It's the first time I have not won in six games. Always you have doubts, [but] not over the principles."Guardiola, whose side host former club Barcelona in the Champions League on Tuesday, made eight changes to his starting XI from Wednesday's 1-0 League Cup defeat at Manchester United.Aguero was among the players to return to City's starting lineup at The Hawthorns and his first-half brace effectively settled the game.He broke the deadlock in the 19th minute, slamming a shot between Ben Foster's legs from Gundogan's pass, and doubled his tally nine minutes later with a stunning shot from the edge of the box.Jordaan tells Mashaba to cast the net beyond SA's borders The goals ended Aguero's six-game scoring drought and lifted his City tally to 149 - one more than club great Francis Lee.Aguero teed up Gundogan for City's third in the 79th minute and the former Borussia Dortmund midfielder sealed victory in the last minute of normal time."We need Sergio," said Guardiola, who dropped the Argentina striker for City's 4-0 defeat at Barcelona.

He has until Monday to respond to the charge and is due to face a disciplinary hearing.Herrera was sent off in the 70th minute after being shown a second yellow card for sliding in on Dean Marney."I think the referee did fantastic work. I won't say more than this," United assistant Rui Faria, who faced the media instead of Mourinho, said sarcastically."The people in the stadium could feel that the players gave everything," he added.
