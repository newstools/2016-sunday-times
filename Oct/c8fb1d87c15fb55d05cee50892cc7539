Tam Baillie said a "wait and see" approach was no longer appropriate.His comments follow the decision by Celtic to feature 13-year-old Karamoko Dembele in its under-20 side against Hearts on Monday.Bookmaker Ladbrokes has since apologised for taking bets on the child's future prospects at Celtic.Dembele, who was born in London in 2003 and whose parents come from Ivory Coast, joined Celtic in July 2013.Since then he has been fast-tracked to appear with players seven years his senior.Following his appearance on Monday, SPFL sponsor Ladbrokes began offering odds of 7/4 on him becoming the youngest Celtic player in history.However, the firm has since apologised and written to Baillie saying it has closed the book on him and taken no bets.In a statement the bookmaker said: "We have written to the children's commissioner this morning, and informed the SPFL of our letter, confirming that no bets were taken on this market before it was removed and to reaffirm our commitment to responsible gambling."We have also sought to clarify that there was no intention of encouraging the commodification of children in Scottish football and have apologised for any offence inadvertently caused."On its website, Celtic FC said "the teenager didn't look out of place" on the pitch on Monday, despite his markedly smaller frame.The club added: "What we need to remember, though, is that Karamoko is just 13 years old. He was given a chance to play last night on merit ... it is very important that we continue their development at a measured pace."Baillie, the Children and Young People's Commissioner, told BBC Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme: "There's very longstanding concern with regard to how professional football clubs treat our children."You've got instances where those contracts pay a pound a week and I believe that HMRC, revenue and customs, have taken an interest in this, and you've got reports that talk about transfers of children, which is quite contrary to any SFA rules."Baillie said that there were too many youngsters involved in the club academy system who would never go on to make the grade as professional football players.He added: "Really the clubs, to some extent, are trading on the dreams and aspirations of those children and young people."But at the end of the day they are exploiting the children for monetary gain."- bbc.com
