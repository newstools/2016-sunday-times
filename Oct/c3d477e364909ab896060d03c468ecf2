Spain's Marc Marquez of Repsol Honda clinched his third world title in four years in Japan a fortnight ago, shifting the focus to nine-time champion Rossi and teammate and rival Lorenzo.They return to Malaysia's steamy Sepang circuit where Rossi last year was accused of sending Marquez sliding out of the race with a kick, earning the Italian legend a back-of-the-grid start in the season-decider at Valencia.Rossi later suggested the penalty - and what he called collusion between fellow Spaniards Lorenzo and Marquez to thwart him in Valencia - cost him the championship."Of course the relationship [with Rossi] has changed a little bit," Marquez said this week, referring to the fallout from Sepang. "Now we have a professional relationship, nothing else." Hamilton rocks, Rosberg flops?Asked to respond, Rossi said coolly: "I agree with Marc."Rossi, 37, blew his hopes of catching Marquez this year to secure a 10th world title when he fell in Japan.But he rides into the Malaysia Grand Prix with momentum after a strong podium last weekend at the Australian Grand Prix.Rossi fought back at Phillip Island from 15th on the grid to take second behind Cal Crutchlow.With two races left, that gave him a 24-point lead over Lorenzo, who put in a relatively lacklustre sixth-place show in Australia.No one has been more successful at Sepang than Rossi, who has six wins here, yet he called it the "toughest race of the season".The Sepang track is one of the trickiest, especially when the tropical weather comes into play.Track temperatures can top 50 C - putting strain on man and machine - and the humidity and sudden heavy downpours can pose control issues.An additional wild card this year is a track resurfacing designed to hasten rain runoff and improve tyre grip.
