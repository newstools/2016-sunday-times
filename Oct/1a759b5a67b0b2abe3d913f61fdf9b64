"Sometimes you win and sometimes you lose. If it were written that the Workers' Party could never lose, that would mean we did not create a political party," he told reporters Tuesday.Amid a deep economic recession and with corruption charges against several of its leaders, including Lula himself, the Workers' Party suffered a major blow on Sunday, losing in the first round almost two thirds of the municipalities it had won just four years ago.The party's worst setback was its loss of Sao Paulo's city hall, where Workers' Party mayor Fernando Haddad was defeated by Joao Doria from the centrist PSDB.A second round runoff had been widely predicted but Doria won outright with 53 percent of the vote."Those who lost in 2012 win now, and those who win now may lose in 2018 or 2022. That is the beauty of democracy, rotation of power and a change in the people who govern," Lula told reporters at a Rio de Janeiro congress of the global union federation IndustriALL.Lula, who was massively popular when he left office in 2010, has been charged by federal prosecutors with taking bribes in a vast embezzlement scheme centered on state oil company Petrobras that they say he oversaw while president.Multiple former allies have already been investigated or indicted in the sprawling probe.And in another blow to Lula's legacy, his handpicked successor Dilma Rousseff was pushed out of the presidency in an impeachment trial this August and replaced by center-right leader Michel Temer.
