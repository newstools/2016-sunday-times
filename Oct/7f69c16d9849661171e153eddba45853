In Tshwane, another metro council now under DA control, the ANC-aligned municipal workers' union stormed the council chambers and disrupted proceedings, forcing the authorities to call in the police.There were also disruptions in Johannesburg as councillors quarrelled over an ANC representative's refusal to leave the house after he had been ordered to do so by the speaker for calling the DA-EFF coalition a "marriage".These incidents, which all happened on the same day, raise troubling questions about the health of our democracy, especially at local level.Since the August 3 local government elections, in which the ANC lost control of the three metros, there have been worrying signs of instability in this important tier of government.There is no justification for violence in a democracy where political differences can be resolved through dialogue and popular vote.While we accept that the reasons for the disruptions this week vary, it is hard not to suspect that at the heart of all of them is the failure by some ANC councillors to accept that they are now in the opposition benches.Instead of accepting their new roles and using their seats on the councils to try to expose the failures of the DA-led coalition governments, these councillors seem to be doing their all to render these municipalities ungovernable.This sends out a troubling message about the future of our country. It says that if the incumbent government loses power at national level in future elections, its supporters may not accept the outcome without a fight.
