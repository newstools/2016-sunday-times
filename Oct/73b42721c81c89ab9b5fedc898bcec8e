 It will look at the SABC board's inability to take legally binding decisions because it lacks a quorum; the SABC's financial sustainability; implementation of former public protector Thuli Madonsela's findings; and the treatement of eight SABC journalists who objected to a policy censoring violent protests.The committee is expected to submit a report to the National Assembly and President Jacob Zuma by the end of next month, asking them to replace the current board with an interim board.Sources close to the inquiry said that once appointed, the interim board was expected to: Review and set aside Hlaudi Motsoeneng's appointment; Cancel the SABC's contract with MultiChoice and recover the R10-million bonus he was allegedly paid to broker it. The R570-million, five-year deal gave MultiChoice a 24-hour SABC news channel and access to SABC archives. Critics said this cost the public broadcaster R2-billion in potential revenue;Deputy loses faith in Faith, goes it alone Rescind Motsoeneng's 90% local content policy; Suspend acting CEO James Aguma and subject him to a disciplinary inquiry; Review all senior appointments for the past five years; Review the SABC's implementation of Madonsela's findings; Conduct a forensic investigation into questionable contracts, and; Review irregular salary increases and start recovering money from the beneficiaries.Witnesses interviewed this week by parliamentary legal advisers said the inquiry should also investigate why Aguma had not been vetted by the State Security Agency.Aguma should have been vetted before being appointed chief financial officer and acting CEO because he controlled a national key point and had access to classified government documents and information.Asked about his vetting, Aguma said it was "an HR matter" and referred queries to SABC spokesman Kaizer Kganyago, who did not respond to repeated questions put to him over three weeks.
