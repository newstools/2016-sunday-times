The battle of the yeast extracts escalated this week when Marmite was yanked from shelves in Britain over a price dispute as the pound plunged."Don't panic about the @marmite shortage @GREATBritain! Your Australian cousins shall send supplies of our superior @Vegemite#Marmitegate," tweeted Sydneysider @dominicpatters.Britain's biggest retailer, Tesco, halted sales of Marmite and other top Unilever brands on Wednesday over a price dispute. Although Unilever later said the supply problem with Tesco had been resolved, the humour lingered on social media.In New Zealand, the British crisis revived memories of the country's own "Marmageddon", which began in March 2012 after the Christchurch factory manufacturing the spread had to close due to earthquake damage.In response to the British shortage, New Zealand rower Eric Murray tweeted a picture of himself looking somewhat smug with a huge jar of the local version to fellow Olympic champion Will Satch after the Briton complained he might have to "go Aussie" and try Vegemite.- AFP
