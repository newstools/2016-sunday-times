Clubs wishing to play in the Premiership must fulfil a list of criteria. This covers areas such as stadia, club administration, community development programmes, ground tenure, facilities, medical and safety, marketing, increasing capacity, adherence to the squad cap as well as playing and contractual commitments.The purpose of the minimum criteria is to set a standard for all clubs to operate by, which all will benefit from.A maximum of two foreign players can be on the pitch at any time, at all periods during the season.In France, the Ligue Nationale de Rugby administer the Top14 and the division below and is owned by privateers. Earlier this year the Ligue concluded a broadcast deal worth R6-billion over four years.The Top 14 boast the highest-paid players in the world - no wonder club owners tend to hold sway over their "property" when it comes to player availability.In Japan too, the clubs tend to rule the roost. Instead of resting with wealthy benefactors, ownership lies largely in the hands of corporations. The Japanese players contracted to the corporations divide their time between working for their employer and playing rugby.In New Zealand private ownership is regulated. Private ownership has in no way affected the principle that All Blacks rugby comes first.
