The government called on the country to avoid "joyful events" for 30 days and to dress in mourning for a year. Travel companies across the region say they are now trying to grasp the potential consequences for their businesses.Hana Tour Service, South Korea's biggest tour operator, expects demand to be hurt during the mourning period, a spokesman said. Representatives of Korean Air Lines, Asiana Airlines and Jetstar, which is owned by Qantas Airways, said they were monitoring the situation.Although it is too early to gauge the immediate impact on tourism, any alcohol restrictions and 12 months of mourning may make Thai resorts less attractive for some vacationers. Thailand has long been a favorite destination for European and Asian holidaymakers, who are drawn to Bangkok's nightlife and southwest island resorts such as Phuket.Tourism accounts for at least 10% of the country's GDP.China's embassy in Thailand issued a notice on its website to remind Chinese tourists to follow traditional customs at public places during this time.The passing of the world's longest-reigning monarch, at the age of 88, was announced on Thursday evening in Bangkok. The national broadcasting regulator banned entertainment programmes for 30 days and warned TV and radio to follow palace protocol in airing news about the king's death.Programming on every TV channel in Thailand was replaced by documentaries about the king's life. The regulator said that would continue until further notice.Ships run by Royal Caribbean Cruises, Princess Cruises - which is owned by Carnival Corporation - and Costa Cruises are among those due to visit Phuket this month.A spokeswoman for Costa Cruises in Hong Kong said the company was assessing whether any changes needed to be made. Royal Caribbean said it had not seen any effect on bookings and had no plans to change itineraries.A Sydney-based spokeswoman for Princess Cruises said the company was checking for any effect on services from the king's death.Some companies see few changes from the king's death.No tours had been called off so far, said Steve Huen, executive director of Hong Kong-based travel agency EGL Tours. And even if some shows such as concerts were cancelled, there was flexibility to change trip schedules, he said.- Bloomberg
