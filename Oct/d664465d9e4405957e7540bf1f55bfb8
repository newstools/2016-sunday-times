Even though chocoholics will have to wait until next year to get their hands on a packet of Caramel M&amp;M's, the news was greeted with glee on social media:there are gonna be caramel m&amp;m's now...if this isnt proof that there is a god idk what iscaramel filled m&amp;m's? pic.twitter.com/AkJoJaZTqDTHERE ARE GOING TO BE CARAMEL FILLED M&amp;M'S!! THIS IS NOT A DRILL. THIS IS REAL. I'M SO HAPPY!!!pic.twitter.com/ZasUHg8MRGWhat will these sweet treats taste like? Think of them as the love child of a regular M&amp;M and a Rolo. They'll have a soft caramel centre engulfed in chocolate with a crisp rainbow-coloured candy shell.Creating the sticky filling was apparently quite a technical challenge. Hank Izzo, vice president of research and development of M&amp;M's parent company Mars Chocolate, told CNN: We've never had an M&amp;M with a true so centre, so we had to figure out how to ensure the chocolate wouldn't be too sticky or too soft, otherwise it would collapse.But, the most important question is: will we be able to get Caramel M&amp;M's in South Africa?Sadly not. Laura Stopforth, a Brand Manager at Mars South Africa, said that the company has no plans to introduce them into the country at this stage.
