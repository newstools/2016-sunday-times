Scores of South Africans are expected to march on the court in Pretoria in support of Gordhan under the banner of Save South Africa. The DA and the EFF are also mobilising their supporters to back him.The SACP has organised a march.ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe confirmed to the Sunday Times he would attend Gordhan's first court appearance.Mantashe will be joined by more than 100 ANC stalwarts who expressed their support of Gordhan in a statement on Friday. Business spots ray of hope after mini-budget ...Trevor Manuel, Frene Ginwala, Ahmed Kathrada, Denis Goldberg, Cheryl Carolus, Zola Skweyiya, Ben Turok and his wife, Mary, Pallo Jordan and Essop Pahad are among the stalwarts who attached their names to the statement. Also on the list are former Zuma backers Siphiwe Nyanda, Sipho Pityana and SACP veteran Eric Mtshali.However, Gordhan's cabinet colleagues will be locked in a meeting in Tuynhuys, Cape Town.Cabinet spokesman Donald Liphoko said attendance was compulsory for ministers."Nonattendance is only permissible through prior arrangement and apologies are processed through the cabinet secretary," he said.The charges brought against Gordhan have revealed cracks in Zuma's cabinet, with those who back the president insisting that the finance minister should face the music as others have labelled the case "bizarre".One minister, who did not want to be named, said many cabinet ministers want to support Gordhan - just as they supported Zuma when he faced charges - but Wednesday's cabinet meeting was too important to miss.The new nuclear build programme is high on the agenda and ministers are due to iron out the logistics of transferring the initiative from the Department of Energy to Eskom."It is one of those important meetings. You must fake sickness if you want to go to court," the minister said.At least eight ministers have come out in support of Gordhan.Tourism Minister Derek Hanekom, who has consistently defended Gordhan, said he would love to be in Pretoria but had to take part in the cabinet meeting."Cabinet is sitting in Cape Town on Wednesday, and the work of government must continue. Pravin would be the first to appreciate that and he knows most of us are fully behind him," he said.Other ministers who have vowed to defend Gordhan against what is seen as a politically motivated charge include Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi and Public Works Minister Thulas Nxesi. Why so many will be rooting for GordhanGordhan is to appear in court on a fraud charge in connection with the case of Ivan Pillay, the former South African Revenue Service deputy commissioner who took early retirement and was rehired on contract.The fallout over the case has spilt over to the ANC, where those who back Gordhan have been accused of being anti-Zuma.Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, who has come out in support of Gordhan, will be in Cape Town on Wednesday.The SACP and Cosatu appear split on the matter. Cosatu president S'dumo Dlamini said: "Why should I go there? I never said I supported Pravin or I don't support Pravin."The SACP has been granted permission to march with 500 protesters. The EFF and the DA will also march from Church Square to the court, with Julius Malema and Mmusi Maimane expected to lead.Tshwane metro police spokesman Senior Superintendent Isaac Mahamba said the metro received applications from four organisations to march on Wednesday.Mahamba said roads around the court would be closed to traffic from 8am to 3pm.
