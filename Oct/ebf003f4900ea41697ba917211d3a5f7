Investors in competitor Clicks - the only pharmacy retailer listed on the JSE - will now be able to compare its performance with that of a smaller rival, but one which has performed well.Alec Abraham, an equity analyst at Sasfin Wealth, said: "Investors who wanted to have access to retail pharmacy only had the option of Clicks, which may be part of the reason why Clicks has performed so well."Over the past year the Clicks share price has gained more than 20% to R122.22."But now with Dis-Chem as another option, you may well find some shareholders switching from Clicks to Dis-Chem," he said.Dis-Chem's revenue is R15.5-billion for the year to February 28, while Clicks had an annual revenue of R25.5-billion.Zahira Osman, a portfolio manager and head of consumer industrials at Afena Capital, said the Dis-Chem listing would provide investors with a direct comparison in the food and drug retail sector."Both companies have ambitious store roll-out plans and the impact on the Clicks Group will depend on the roll-out of profitable space and the impact on market share. Growth in space should manifest profitably and not result in cannibalisation of the existing store base," said Osman.The group intended to offer 238.4million shares at between R16.25 and R20.25 each, which would represent 27.5% of its issued share capital, Dis-Chem said.The company's existing shareholders are the Saltzman Family Trust, which holds 66.9%; management, which holds 23.4%; and an unknown financial investor holding 9.7%.

The remainder of the proceeds will be for general corporate purposes, including the group's strategic growth development.Dis-Chem agreed to lease terms for 29 new stores to be opened between the financial year ended February 29 2016 and its 2018 financial year. Three of these stores were opened this year.Over the past eight years the 38-year-old retailer has more than tripled its store base to 103 in South Africa and Namibia.Clicks remains the largest retail pharmacy chain with more than 360 pharmacies.Osman said Clicks had been able to capitalise on rural opportunities, where access to pharmacy services wa s low."The pace of pharmacy roll-out is also highly dependent on securing licences and pharmacists," said Osman.This week Clicks CEO David Kneale announced plans to invest R577-million next year with a planned 25 store openings and the refurbishment of 65 stores."The listing is going to be more competition in the market for Clicks. Dis-Chem have a similar kind of profitability although it shows that the growth rate that they gave over the last few years seems to be slightly higher than Clicks," said Abraham.Kneale was optimistic about Clicks's future."We are positive about our prospects for the medium to long term," he said.Dis-Chem is expected to start trading on the JSE on November 18.
