While the players have dutifully and diligently deposited a Herculean effort on the field, the soulful sounds stemming from the stands have served as the wind beneath the wings of the Brazilians.The melodic acapellas have silenced the noisy vuvuzela that once echoed through the terraces. Every victory has been greeted with well choreographed jives and accompanied by beautiful singing that helped to create a carnival atmosphere at the Lucas Masterpieces Moripe Stadium.Even when they were outthought, outmanoeuvred and played off the pitch by Bidvest Wits in the 3-0 MTN8 final loss, they never blinked. Vociferous Sundowns supporters take over Egyptian city in show of support for the BraziliansIn pouring rain, they sung, danced and saluted their soldiers in defeat. It was a beautiful sight.They saved the best for last with a full house in the first leg last weekend. It was goose-bump stuff as their melodic encouragement lifted the foot soldiers to secure a 3-0 advantage.This conduct is noteworthy as it signals a significant shift in their previous behaviour.In the past, the fans were problematic. It was not unusual for some sections of Downs fans to resort to violence to display their displeasure at the coach.Even Pitso Mosimane was wantonly pelted with missiles. But angry calls of "Pitso must go" have been replaced by "Pitso Mosimane, ha ho na o tshwanang le wena" (Pitso Mosimane, there is no one like you).Correcting the behaviour of the fans has been a crucial component in ensuring that everyone is singing from the same hymn book, focused on a common goal of achieving glory in the World Cup of club football in Africa.Such has been their commitment to the cause that some among them hitchhiked all the way to Ndola, Zambia for the semifinal first leg. That gesture didn't escape the eye of club president Patrice Motsepe.The billionaire has benevolently paid for a travelling party of just under 200 fans to enable them to witness what, in prospect, stands as the finest chapter in the existence of the club founded in Marabastad 40 years ago. Here's hoping that the Chloorkop choir will be in mellow voice come full time this evening.
