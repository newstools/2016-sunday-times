In a first step to establishing a presence in the East African market, the South African retailer will take its TFG, Markham and Sterns brands to the Village Market mall in Nairobi.TFG director Manie Maritz said this week: "TFG sees Kenya as a good investment destination because the retail environment and infrastructure are relatively well developed compared to other East and West African countries."TFG's investments in Africa are made with a medium- to long-term view. Therefore, our target remains to have around 250 to 300 stores in African countries outside South Africa by 2022."TFG currently also has 184 stores in Namibia, Botswana, Swaziland, Lesotho, Zambia and Ghana.But Maritz said the pace of expansion into Kenya depended on successful trading in the new stores and the availability of appropriate retail space.Although TFG has more than 2200 stores, it has only one Sterns store in Kenya, which opened in September.Other South African retailers have staked their claim in Kenya, such as Woolworths with nine stores and Truworths with five franchise stores.With Kenya's GDP expanding at 6.2% year on year, and South Africa's economy gaining only 3.3% in the second quarter, it's no wonder investors are looking to add Kenyan shillings to their balance sheets. Retailers ready for battle of GrinchesCraig Henry, Nielsen MD for retail in Africa and the Middle East, said Kenya's retail sector was "fairly sophisticated" in the way they operate."The development of the market in Kenya has been quite rapid, although there are still some opportunities for a better product mix."They've got similar systems to South Africa, they've got loyalty programmes, in some cases they do online e-commerce business. In that respect they are keeping abreast of what's happening in global markets."According to a 2015 Nielsen report, Kenya is the second-biggest formalised retail economy after South Africa in the sub-Saharan region. Its rapid development of shopping malls and e-commerce activities puts it ahead of its African peers.But South African retailers have been burnt on the continent as they failed to win consumers over with their product offering.In 2014, Africa's largest grocery retailer, Shoprite, pulled out of East Africa, selling its stores to Nakumatt."South African retailers have struggled in getting the balance [right] between the shopping environment and the cost of getting goods to Kenya," he said.In the past year, most retailers have invested heavily offshore to hedge against weak economies.TFG bought the Whistles and Phase Eight brands in the UK as it sought growth outside an Africa facing depressed commodity prices and drought.But TFG's investments in Kenya may set the scene for other South African retailers to look again for a piece of the African pie.
