Unfortunately, the 160th instalment of "El Kasico" short-changed the multitude of fans who braved the traffic and the heat to watch South Africa's two biggest team slug out a 50th draw.It promised much but delivered little.If it wasn't for the rivalry and the supporters who make this game the special occasion that it is, the lack of substantive footballing quality in Chiefs/Pirates matches would consign it to a run-of-the-mill league match.Fear of losing has reduced this occasion to nothing more than a "drawby"; it will take a special kind of fan to remember this game.While the Soweto Derby will always be the most significant game in domestic circles, it's never easy to say which side carries momentum after the match. There is pressure on the sides not to lose, which explains the high draw percentage of the fixture.How they play before and after this match has no meaning in the grander scheme of things, even though Baroka FC may fancy their chances on Wednesday when they meet Chiefs in Durban.While Pirates showed far better defensive discipline, Stuart Baxter has always found a way to unlock Pirates and he will target their aerial nervousness when SuperSport United face them in Mbombela on Tuesday evening.At least Pirates kept their unbeaten league run while Chiefs have now gone six games unbeaten.Muhsin Ertugral pulled the biggest tactical surprise by omitting club captain Oupa Manyisa from the match-day squad.While Manyisa has battled to recapture the form that made him the stand out militant midfield midget, he tends to save his best for the derby.Ertugral's now habitual defensive tinkering saw him start with Ntshikelelo Nyauza on the right with Edwin Gyimah and Happy Jele being the preferred centreback combination.They were spared a thorough first-half examination because of Chiefs' inability to string key passes together in the final third.Clear-cut opportunities were few and far between with Thabo Rakhale's 23rd-minute chance, which was well foiled by Itumeleng Khune, the best one of the half.Riyaad Norodien's crisp passing and pace from an unfamiliar central midfield position was at the heart of that flowing movement.The Capetonian was a surprise starter ahead of Luvuyo Memela and acquitted himself well in the Derby cauldron.Such was the calculated chess- match nature of the rather turgid first stanza, no spoils could be claimed even though Lorenzo Gordinho's timely blocking of Rakhale's 45th-minute attempt probably saved Chiefs' bacon.Hendrick Ekstein missed an even easier chance a minute later when he blasted William Twala's cross over the bar.At least the collective groan from that instance was replaced by the applause for the half-time ball jugglers whose exquisite ball control was a key missing ingredient from the main football course.While the second half was lit up by Gift Motupa and Siphiwe Tshabalala chances at the opposite ends of the period, it was clear that the sides were never going to be able to shake off their nervousness.The quality of the football got better, especially with Tshabalala pulling the strings in his free-ranging midfield role after coming on as a sub, but Pirates' defensive resolve and pride would not allow them to drop their first home game of the season.It will take a lot for the fans to rock up for the next league instalment in March next year and there could be more orange seats staring at the players, even though the bottom two tiers were packed.
