The defending champion and 12-time grand slam champion was broken once in the first set and three times in the second as he lost 6-4 6-4 in his first defeat to the Spaniard.Djokovic has been out of sorts since he won his first French Open title in June, losing early at Wimbledon and the Olympics and complaining he had lost motivation.The 29-year-old Serb, whose top ranking is under threat from Andy Murray, hummed to keep up his spirits during his quarterfinal escape against German qualifier Mischa Zverev.But the three-time champion failed to stay cool in a stormy appearance at Shanghai's Qi Zhong Tennis Centre as he suffered a rare defeat in China.Nineteenth-ranked Bautista put away two brilliant forehands as he fought off break points in the ninth game.He then pounced as Djokovic was serving to stay in the first set of this absorbing tie.A sublime disguised lob set up break point and when Djokovic fired wide to hand over the set, he snapped and repeatedly slammed his racquet into the deck.Djokovic grabbed a towel and cleaned up his racquet splinters as the second set got under way, but tempers frayed again at 1-1 over a serve he felt was long."I'm so happy," said Bautista, after beating Djokovic at the sixth attempt to reach his first Masters final. "I'm just so happy how I've played."I'm feeling really good on this court and I hope to enjoy it until the last point here."Bautista will play Murray in today's final.
