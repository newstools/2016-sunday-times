Donald Trump called the announcement "bigger than Watergate", and Clinton appeared blindsided by the news, declining to mention it during a rally in Iowa.FBI director James Comeywrote to members of Congress informing them that new e-mails had been found that were "pertinent to the investigation" of Clinton.He said the e-mails were recovered during an unrelated probe, and would be reviewed to determine whether they contained classified information, or could shed new light on the case.The e-mails were found during an investigation into illicit text messages between Anthony Weiner, the former congressman, and a 15-year-old girl, according to the New York Times. Huma Abedin, Weiner's wife, is one of Clinton's closest aides. The Trump machine is both fascinating and horrifyingClinton later called on the FBI to release all information on the new e-mails. She was confident the FBI's conclusion in July that she should not be prosecuted would not change."The American people deserve to get the full and complete facts immediately. It's imperative that the bureau explain this issue in question, whatever it is, without any delay ... I think people a long time ago made up their minds about the e-mails."When asked by a reporter whether the latest controversy would sink her campaign, Clinton laughed.Comey had closed the investigation into Clinton's e-mail practices in July after determining there was insufficient evidence that she had knowingly put US secrets at risk by using an unsecured server to conduct government business.Comey said at the time that Clinton had been "extremely careless" but that no criminal charges were warranted.Trump spoke in New Hampshire after the announcement and his supporters broke into chants of "Lock her up" as he relayed the news.He applauded the FBI for having the "courage" to reopen the investigation, and said he hoped the agency would correct the "horrible mistake" it had made in recommending that Clinton not be indicted. "Hillary Clinton's corruption is on a scale we have never seen before. We must not let her take her criminal scheme into the Oval Office," the Republican nominee said.Meanwhile, Comey is facing pressure to explain himself for reviving a previously completed investigation into Clinton's e-mail practices.Former prosecutors and members of Congress from both parties expressed shock and dismay at his highly unusual decision, which flouted decades of legal custom by taking actions that could affect an election. Comey and the FBI are in a terrible position here, one in which they would be accused of playing politics whatever they ended up doing "It's really hard to have confidence in the integrity and nonpartisan nature of the FBI," said Anne Weismann, a former Justice Department official.A former federal prosecutor, Nick Akerman, said Comey "has no business" making this decision so close to the election. "I've never seen this before, not even [in the days of] J Edgar Hoover," he said, referring to the longtime FBI director who was criticised for investigations of Martin Luther King jnr and other civil rights activists.Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat in the US Senate, said: "The FBI has a history of extreme caution near election day so as not to influence the results. Today's break from that tradition is appalling." 'He just want his face everywhere' Donald Trump not a New York favouriteChuck Grassley, a Republican senator, said Comey's action "left a lot more questions than answers for the FBI and secretary Clinton".Comey, a 55-year-old former Republican, came to the job as FBI director in 2013 with a reputation for fierce impartiality. But he has since taken a series of actions that have left him increasingly isolated .Early this year he brought a court case seeking to compel Apple to hack into an iPhone used by a dead terrorist. The bureau later bought a tool to help it get access to the phone.In July, when the FBI investigation of Clinton was winding down, Comey said that "our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case". It went beyond what was expected because a final decision on whether to pursue a case is normally left to the attorney-general.Comey said he could not say how long the review would take.Benjamin Wittes, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said: "If you're inclined to be angry with Comey over this, imagine that he had not said something and it emerged after the election that, having testified that the investigation was complete, he authorised additional investigation of a new trove of e-mails."Comey and the FBI are in a terrible position here, one in which they would be accused of playing politics whatever they ended up doing."- The Daily Telegraph, London and Bloomberg
