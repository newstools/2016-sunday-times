Here are four current fashion trends that dominated the red carpet:Black and white were the standout colours of the night.Celebs like Bonang Matheba who looked striking in a sculptural Marchesa gown and Miss SA Ntandoyenkosi Kunene opted to wear sophisticated black head-to-toe.Personality Dineo Moeketsi - whose OTT outfit didn't go down well with the 'fashion police' on Twitter - was one of those who kept it summery in all-white.Others, such as actress Minnie Dlamini and singer Yemi Alade, who won the Best Female Act award, mixed it up with a combination of the two timeless hues.Miss SA Ntandoyenkosi #MTVMAMA2016 pic.twitter.com/vjqTRWClNR</img>Bonang Matheba on the red carpet at the MTV Africa Music Awards 2016.

Get it right and sheer outfits can be feminine and sexy. Get it wrong and they can look more streetwalker than chic.A photo posted by Ayanda Thabethe (@ayandathabethe_) on Oct 22, 2016 at 10:37am PDT LOOK at them.

Whether it's a top or a dress, a piece that shows off those collarbones has a subtle sexy appeal and will make you feel wonderfully feminine.
