Arsenal have finished in the top four every year under Wenger but that consistency has become a stick with which to beat him - proof of the bloody-mindedness of the professorial Frenchman for whom the beautiful game means just that.When he took charge on October 1 1996, Wenger sanctioned the signing of Frenchman Patrick Vieira as the midfield linchpin.He had inherited Dutch master Dennis Bergkamp and livewire striker Ian Wright. But his real skill was teaching old dogs new tricks - extending the careers of defensive cavaliers Tony Adams, Steve Bould, Nigel Winterburn and Lee Dixon. Mourinho threatened to break Arsene Wenger's faceAdding Emmanuel Petit, winger Marc Overmars and striker Nicolas Anelka into the mix, Wenger's side won the league and FA Cup double in his first full season. Over the next three campaigns they were runners-up in a ferocious battle for supremacy with Manchester United.Another double arrived in 2001/02 before Wenger's 2003/04 "Invincibles" won the title without losing a match."I learned that you can achieve things that you think are not achievable," he said .Wenger turned Arsenal into the most watchable side in England and their supporters self-mockingly chanted "Boring, boring Arsenal" as the likes of Thierry Henry, who under Wenger became the club's record scorer, Bergkamp, Robert Pires and Freddie Ljungberg dazzled defences.Arsenal's loss to Barcelona in the Champions League final saw the break-up of the squad, though, with Bergkamp retiring, Pires leaving and Ashley Cole joining Chelsea, while Henry left for Barcelona in 2007 and won the Champions League in 2009.As money swept into English football, Arsenal's purse strings tightened as paying off the debts incurred to build the stadium became a priority.Wenger tried to counter the spending of Chelsea and Manchester United, building a side around Robin van Persie and Cesc Fabregas, but silverware remained elusive. The famine ended in 2014 when Arsenal won the FA Cup and then defeated Aston Villa to retain the trophy.But Wenger's contract is up at the end of this season and he is being tipped as England's next boss, although Winterburn says he has unfinished business at Arsenal."It's been sticky since 2006, but I know he's very driven still," said the former Arsenal fullback."There are some promising signs over the last few weeks. This time seems different."
