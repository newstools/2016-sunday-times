Airbnb has launched another promotional campaign, this time listing Bran Castle in Transylvania - the inspiration for Dracula's castle in Bram Stoker's gothic horror novel - on the most ghoulish night of the year.The one-night event will be hosted by the great grandnephew of Bram Stoker, Dacre Stoker, a vampire expert who will share his insight on the dark and blood-curdling vampire world and explain the historical connection between the fictional character of Count Dracula and Vlad the Impaler. Bran Castle is where the legend of Dracula was born, and I have many stories to share as I guide the guests through the dark secret passages of the castle for a private unveiling of its many mysteries. Bram Stoker included many references to real people and real historical anecdotes and questioned whether vampires are really a myth at all, Stoker said in a statement.Europe's 25 cheapest destinations according to AirbnbUpon arrival, two guests will retrace the fictional steps of the novel's protagonist Jonathan Harker, as they're shuttled by horse-drawn carriage towards the gates of the 14th century castle at dusk.The visitors will tour the castle's dark corridors and explore secret passageways before being led to an intimate candlelit dinner in the grand dining room, where they will tuck into robber beef steak and paprika hendl chicken, as served in the book.To cap off the deliciously frightful experience, guests will slip into velvet-trimmed coffins in the count's crypt, where they will try to find slumber between the castle walls.At the break of day, when the sun rises and they're clear out of danger, the guests will be served a dawn breakfast on the castle terrace.Winners will be flown from anywhere in the world. The contest closes October 26 at 11:59 CET.It's not the first time Airbnb has offered guests the chance to get their fright on.
