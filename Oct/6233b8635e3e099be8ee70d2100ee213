For some it s that a helping of beans comes with a helping of gas, or that they feel uncomfortably bloated after eating them. But that doesn t mean they have to be permanently off the menu.Building up your tolerance to pulses by eating small portions of them over time may help, suggests Maretha Vermaak of Milk SA s Consumer Education Project.Soaking and rinsing dry pulses before cooking, and rinsing canned varieties well before use, may also put a stop to digestive woes. This can help to reduce hard-to-digest carbohydrates which could cause flatulence, says dietician Jessica Byrne.As an added bonus soaking dry pulses will cut down the cooking time.Another way to speed things up is to only season your pulses once they re done.
