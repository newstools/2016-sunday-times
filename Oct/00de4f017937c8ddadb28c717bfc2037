The chilling character of Warrant Officer Rautenbach in Shepherds and Butchers is sure to set tongues wagging when the film opens in cinemas.Award-winning actor Deon Lotz combined his military training and acting skills to pull off the ruthless persona of the officer, whose task it is to induct younger officers in the procedure of hanging people on death row.WATCH: Wolverine in action in the new 'Logan' trailerIt was a challenge for the actor."What these guys had to do in reality was no joke and must have been very difficult up to a point - then I suppose you get used to it," said Lotz."I could not relate to the character but understood the discipline and respect for the job. The brutal physical dragging of the prisoners to the gallows and trying to stay true to the story was a challenge."His character, Rautenbach, oversees the officers tasked with chaperoning prisoners on their walk to the gallows.One of these is warder Leon Labuschagne - played by 20-year-old actor Garion Dowds - who at the age of 17 is sent to work on death row as punishment for falling asleep on guard duty. He is given no training or psychological counselling.The young warder winds up on death row himself after committing multiple murders.WATCH the trailer for 'Shepherds and Butchers':SheperdsDirector Oliver Schmitz had researched the story since the late 1980s.He described capital punishment in apartheid South Africa as "an effective killing machine that hung both criminal and political prisoners. What happened there was kept under lock and key."I could not have done this back then. It would have felt like an apology back then."I had researched a project about Robert McBride on death row in the late '80s. I visited him over 20 times and worked on that project about five years, so I had intimate knowledge of the institution.Ironically, although it is a museum now, it's hard to get in there and what I know of the place is based on my visits back then," said Schmitz.The director, who is based in Berlin, said he used some information from a warder who offered "generous and unconditional help after he went to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission with his experiences", which aided in the sculpting of some of the characters in the film, including that of Rautenbach."He is the first insider who broke the code of secrecy and the novel Shepherds &amp; Butchers (written by Chris Marnewick and published in 2008) is partly based on his experiences."Getting him involved helped me and the actors to access a world and a mindset that thankfully does not exist any more."We realised that he is still incredibly burdened by his experiences but are thankful he shared them with us," said Schmitz. Being in this film is important in telling people that the death penalty is not always the answer for the problem of violence and murder Although Lotz never got a chance to be part of the research he heeded the call and played his role brilliantly."After reading the script and having a meeting with an adviser, it was not difficult to put myself in the shoes of the character. I did not feel much at the first execution ... no emotions, it's a job."Being in this film is important in telling people that the death penalty is not always the answer for the problem of violence and murder - this debate should be had and we need to address the problem of violence in our country and come up with a different solution," said Lotz.He said he hoped his character could teach audiences about the impact of the death penalty, which was abolished in South Africa in 1995."I hope that the film will be well received in South Africa and trust that we will not only focus on the past when it happened but also open up debate about the merits of the death penalty as so many keep on calling for it," said Lotz.
