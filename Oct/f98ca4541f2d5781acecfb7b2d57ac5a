The US Ryder Cup player aced Sheshan International Golf Club's treacherous par-three 17th, but was 24 hours too late to win a new luxury Cadillac CT6 40T Prem."It was the saddest hole-in-one," Kuchar told reporters. "I knew I just made a hole-in-one and I was teased by this beautiful car sitting there, that's not to be mine."During Thursday and Friday's opening two rounds of the WGC-HSBC Champions in Shanghai the car had been on offer to anyone who could make a hole-in-one.But yesterday, the teeing ground was moved up inside 180 metres as its turf had cut up badly in wet conditions this week. The reduced length of the usually 194-metre hole negated the sponsor's insurance cover - meaning no car could be given away."Literally, a minute before my shot, I found out," Kuchar said."There's a car sitting there, the most beautiful Cadillac sitting on a tee with the note below saying, 'This hole is under 180 metres, thus no longer qualifies for the insurance for the giveaway for the prize'." He said he wasn't sure how he was going to explain it all to his young golf-mad son."I've got this nine-year-old son that's just a golf junkie, always asking have I ever made a hole-in-one with a car on it," said Kuchar.Kuchar soon found out why the tee had been moved and said he knew who to blame. "Henrik Stenson came up and said: 'My fault, the back tee box was not in very good shape'."He was the one that asked for the tees to be moved forward," said Kuchar.He added with a smile: "He owes me something." The ace did help propel Kuchar to a 68 and to nine-under for the tournament.
