'The Yoga Kitchen' cookbook makes eating superfoods, super easy"We wanted to show the diversity of our country and the spirit of our people in the cookbook," says Doyle."The balance of recipes was tricky; we wanted to incorporate our traditional boboties and biltong while also highlighting some of our green warriors in ingredients. We also wanted to include people who are breaking new boundaries in food."The team of Jules Mercer (stylist and project manager), Toby Murphy (photographer) and Brad Theron (videographer) had five months to put it together."It was excruciatingly difficult to select the personalities featured in the book. To start, we appointed a steering committee: Reuben Riffel, Errieda du Toit, Cass Abrahams, Anna Trapido, Dorah Sithole, David Higgs, Phillippa Cheifitz, and Hilary Biller; we then compiled a list and ran it by the committee."There's a bittersweet irony in a book produced in a country where so many face starvation daily. Hopefully, the book will help raise awareness of the vast and complex issues around food security in SA. If we sell 50,000 copies, it would raise a meaningful amount that could go towards food security and changing many peoples lives."Try celebrity chef Siba Mtongana's chorizo &amp; broccolini papizza recipe from 'The Great South African Cookbook' (Quivertree, R450)
