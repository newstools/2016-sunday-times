Financed by Donate Life America, the film stars indie actor Thomas Jane (The Thin Red Line; Stander) as Coleman Sweeney, who has a postgraduate degree in assholity.Sweeney is a sleazy lowlife who throws small change at strippers and tosses urine-filled beer bottles out of his truck on the highway. He is a creepy bully who verbally abuses animals, children, old people and the disabled.When he dies, however, Sweeney's organs save the lives of good people who gather to pay tribute to him, with the payoff line: "Even an asshole can save a life."Two weeks after the film was released, organ donor registrations had increased by 700%, said Joe Alexander, chief creative director of The Martin Agency, the ad company that convinced Donate Life to approve the "asshole" concept.Alexander told Forbes: "We drew on stories about donor families being surprised that a family member had registered to be a donor because they were an 'asshole' in life.We liked the juxtaposition of the incredible gift against the reality that in life the person could have done better, but in death, they were selfless. And boom - now we have The World's Biggest Asshole."asshole
