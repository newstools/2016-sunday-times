Hawaiian Airlines says the requirement is about safety - distributing passengers based on their weight evenly around the cabin could help prevent crash landings and make the flights more economical.The rule, however, applies only to flights between Honolulu and Pago Pago in American Samoa, which has the highest rates of obesity in the world. Now your luggage can carry you The airline won the right earlier this year to trial the new policy for a six-month period, scrapping all pre-booked seating for the flight and assigning passengers their seats on check-in.Hawaiian Airlines said it had originally conducted a voluntary passenger weight survey for six months and found that the average passenger and carry-on luggage was heavier than expected.Travellers have described the policy as discriminatory. Since September 29, six complaints have been filed to the US Department of Transportation.Samoa Air has been setting fares according to passenger weight since 2013. But that airline flies much smaller planes - two 10-seaters and a four-seater - than the Boeing 767-300, used on the flight in question, which can fly 269 passengers at a time.A Hawaiian Airlines spokesperson has been quoted as saying: "This action resulted from the recognition that over time our fuel burn on Pago Pago flights was consistently much higher than projected, indicating that our weight assumptions were inaccurate."
