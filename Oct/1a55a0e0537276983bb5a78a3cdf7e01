It was not just the emphatic scoreline, but the gulf in class of the two teams' performances that make it extremely unlikely - as long as Downs keep calm and play sensible football - that Zamalek can come back from this defeat in the second leg in Alexandria next Sunday.Anthony Laffor had become typecast in the role of Downs' super-sub.In recent weeks, apparently stung by claims by coach Pitso Mosimane that the "difficult" Liberian can waste substitute options with ineffective performances when starting, Laffor laid a claim for a first XI place - especially when he scored in the fifth minute of Downs' semifinal second leg against Zambians Zesco United.Influential as the in-form big man has been for Downs in the past six weeks - also setting up the crucial away goal against Zesco - he muddied the waters on whether he should start yesterday by having to be substituted at half time in Downs' 3-0 MTN8 final shock by Bidvest Wits two weeks ago.Mosimane, though, went with his instincts and started the forward for the big occasion. Laffor did not disappoint, smashing in the 32nd-minute goal Downs needed to take the pressure off.Goals followed from Tebogo Langerman (40th minute) - perhaps fortunately from what appeared an attempted cross - then an own goal under immense pressure in the 46th by centreback Eslam Hamed.Zamalek have even worse limitations to their squad than Sundowns, caused by movements during their change in seasons and arrived with 14 outfield players.But that should not detract from the masterful performance of what could just be declared the best team seen in SA since the beginning of the Premier Soccer League era in 1996.In a week they should be the first PSL team to be crowned African champions - in 1995 Orlando Pirates did it in the old National Soccer League era, in the old Champions Cup format.Sundowns will have won many admirers across the continent for the football they have played in this Champions League. It has been relentlessly beautiful and beautifully brutal.Roared on by a packed home crowd they played close to a perfect first half.Downs came out spreading the ball, squeezing out the skill, muscling the advantage in search of an early goal as Percy Tau and Tebogo Langerman streaked into Zamalek's area in the early exchanges.The Brazilians paced themselves too. They did not put all their eggs in an early goal basket. But when Laffor, Khama Billiat, Keagan Dolly and Percy Tau turned things on in attack, Zamalek's defensive structure had little answer.When you're attempting to establish dominance of a team, an emphatic opening goal is not out of place. Laffor provided it.Big midfielder Hlompo Kekana's deftest of passes through the middle found the Liberian a foot past the defence but played onside to turn and strike thunderously into the roof of goalkeeper Ahmed Elshenawy's net.When a second with an element of fortune, or brilliance, came five minutes before the break, Downs accepted it gratefully.Fullback Langerman floated in what looked like a cross from left midfield, and which dipped in over Elshenawy's head too perfectly to have possibly been intended as a strike at goal.Downs went immediately on attack at the start of the second half and 53 seconds in Tau's low ball was turned into his own net by Hamed.Sundowns - 0Zamalek - 0sports@timesmedia.co.za
