It's a somewhat solemn route, driving to Johannesburg's 1 Fox Street precinct, accompanied as you are by historical giants like the Magistrate's Court and the Johannesburg Central police station along your way.Ferreirasdorp certainly has a story or two to tell.Its latest addition is the new Mad Giant Brewery with its inhouse restaurant, Urbanologi, a welcome, whimsical addition to the historically rich precinct.As you enter the brewery, you are welcomed by a seven-metre yellow yeti. It cheekily sets the tone for the space, a combined brewery and restaurant whose products are as experimental and playful as the d cor lets on.Last year chef Angelo Scirocco won the San Pellegrino Young Chef 2015 for Africa and Middle East. He went on to open Urbanologi, a playground for his creative culinary philosophy.3 foodie highlights of Joburg's hip new art & design hubThe menu focuses on Angelo's self-dubbed "Urban Garde" cuisine. He describes it as "inspired by urban culture, a fusion between art, street food and avant garde cuisine".The restaurant and brewery work side by side, brainstorming and testing new ideas in terms of flavours, ingredients, processes and techniques."The essence of our food comes from using the highest quality of fresh Asian and local ingredients while harnessing the character of street food with an avant garde thought process," the team explains.The menu is divided into six sections - fried, kushiyaki (skewered and grilled meat and vegetables), steamed, cured, frozen and raw. The idea is to pick and choose several of the tapas-sized dishes to share.This menu is not for those with simple tastes. It is packed with interesting flavour combinations.It has options like cured and smoked pork neck with quince puree, steamed baby bok choy and rooibos ginger glaze, coal-fired beef fillet with soya-braised eringi mushroom and aubergine in broth, and fermented turnip with raisin, white anchovy, parsley and deep-fried potato beignets.A good wine, gin, whisky and sake list complements the menu, but the real highlights are the beers, freshly brewed on site.A taster selection, with 100ml of each of the pilsner, weissbier, pale ale and amber ale, makes for a great way to start your meal.Rosto eatery shows Joburg there's more to Italian food than pizzaThe d cor is a visual treat.All the furniture is bespoke, and includes a range of original pieces by Haldane Martin, who conceptualised the interiors.The ceramics are made by Mervyn Gers.
