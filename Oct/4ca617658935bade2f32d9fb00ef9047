Black, worn head to toe, is making a comeback. This was apparent at SA Fashion Week's AW17 presentations - from sexy and sophisticated to avant garde and ready to wear, designers served enough black to last a season or two.Of course, black has always had its place on local and international runways, no matter the year or season. It was good to see our local designers bringing fresh perspectives and new ideas to the ramp; some dedicating entire collections to the enduring shade. Clive Rundle's collection was a reflection of craftsmanship; a range full of rich textures, contrasting colours and themes inspired by the East. One eye-catching piece was a metallic wrap jacket worn over a skirt with a deconstructed hemline. Then came Lumin, the winner of this year's Sunglass Hut new talent search, who opted for an entirely black collection. Experimenting with a mix of sheer fabric and woollen cover-ups, their looks brought a new take to winter elegance. Another designer who chose wool as their primary texture was Etsa, with a collection that had models strutting the ramp with sculptured and voluminous silhouettes. Rubicon also went for black, with a small element of gold. The collection's sweeping garments, with its tulle and satin detailing, brought a feminine allure and charisma to the show.While most collections went all-out with their designs, Somerset Jane took a modern and minimalist approach with a collection that incorporated a number of ready-to-wear items. Our favourite was a tailored black two-piece with flap detailing that gave character to the shirt-and-pants combination. On the last evening of the women's wear collections, Vintage Zionist showed a grunge-inspired collection with interpretations of leather from biker jackets to rompers - and a large dose of attitude.Final words: Some things will always be stylish - and black definitely stands the test of time.
