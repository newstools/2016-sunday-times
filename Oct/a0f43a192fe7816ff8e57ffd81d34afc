Former Borussia Dortmund boss Klopp has transformed Liverpool since replacing Brendan Rodgers 12 months ago. And Argentina icon Maradona named the German as the coach who most catches his eye."I love what he conveys, the type that gives me confidence," he told Marca. "Before at Dortmund and now in the Premier League, Klopp is always going forward."Maradona also praised the work ethic of Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone, and named Roberto Lewandowski as the "world's best pure striker".Mourinho saw redJOSE Mourinho made desperate attempts to become Liverpool manager in 2004, according to reports.After winning the Champions League with FC Porto, he was appointed Chelsea manager by Roman Abramovich in the summer of 2004.However, according to a report, Mourinho sent his agent at the time, Jorge Baideck, to Anfield on the day Porto famously knocked Manchester United out of Europe.The previous day, Baideck had met Liverpool boss Gerard Houllier to discuss potential transfers, but returned on March 9 to meet Reds chief executive Rick Parry.The report states: "A full charm offensive ensued. Mourinho was a huge admirer of Liverpool and was enchanted by the idea of working at Anfield, a venue he had long revered."He was so keen that he had identified Liverpool as his ideal destination once his departure from Porto was confirmed."The seriousness of the approach was clear. Liverpool were in the enviable position of having one of football management's rising stars telling them they were the ones he wanted."The problem was - and this was a significant one for a club which prided itself on doing things the right way and following their own procedures - Liverpool already had a manager in Houllier. In terms of professional etiquette and common decency, there was something about Baideck's brazen attempt to see his client oust Houllier hours after trying to sell players to the Frenchman which did not sit well with the Anfield hierarchy."Houllier was under pressure with Liverpool sixth in the league, but the club had taken no decision to replace the Frenchman.Club chiefs were wary of derailing Houllier's attempts to guide Liverpool into the top four, and were then put off by Mourinho's touchline antics at Old Trafford.This allowed Chelsea to make an offer to Mourinho via Jorge Mendes, who then became the current Manchester United manager's agent.- football365.com
