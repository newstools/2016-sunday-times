It is snuggled between stands promoting adult-entertainment actresses and sex toys, and is just a few paces from where the artist known as Pricasso paints with his penis.The Christian organisation is distributing pamphlets on human trafficking."We are not here to collect money, preach or judge," said Major Carin Holmes. "All we want is for people to know about the horrors of human trafficking, much of which is linked to the sex trade."It is a big problem in this country and the second-largest profit-making crime in the world, next to drug trafficking. We are saying people shouldn't accept jobs from strangers as they might be held against their will."Holmes said Sexpo was appropriate to convey the message and be visible for anyone wanting help.In its 10th year, the human sensuality and lifestyle expo has attracted international adult-entertainment stars including Jessica Drake, who has claimed to be a victim of sexual harassment by Donald Trump.Trump allegedly offered Drake $10,000 and the use of his private plane if she would come to his room and later accompany him to a party.Drake would not talk about Trump this week, but focused on teaching couples how to improve their sex lives. It was less about positions than "helping build their self-confidence during sex".Sexpo is expected to draw 60,000 people today.
