The Johannesburg duo have developed a smartphone application - ZA Emoji keyboard.It contains images, words and phrases that help South Africans express themselves in the cyber world using local lingo and homegrown emojis."Lekker", "aweh", "haibo", "kwaai", "muti" and "hola" are some of the local phrases available on the app.It also has gestures for hailing a minibus taxi, koeksisters, boerewors, the old SABC test pattern and a potjie pot."Within 45 days of its launch, the app - which is available free on iOS and Android phones - has been downloaded more than 1,000 times, mostly by young women from Gauteng and the Western Cape.A recent Twitter data survey revealed that South Africans use the both-hands-raised emoji in celebration the most. Canadians and Americans mostly use the weary face."The idea for the app was born when we realised the growth in the use of communication apps," said Sikhuza. "South Africans are adopting a foreign and largely American way of expressing themselves online. Masters of innovation sidestep chaos on university campuses"Some of the emoji icons and pictures are not relevant in the South African context and tend to limit how we express ourselves."Erasmus said that they wanted to develop an app that would help South Africans communicate "in a way that is familiar"."We hope that in some small way the app can bridge the cultural divides and help to build a more cohesive South Africa," said Erasmus."The images, words, phrases, animals and places are South African," Sikhuza said. International research shows that communicating with emojis is the fastest-growing language in history Erasmus said local expressions were proving the most popular."From the bug you used to find under a stone as a kid, to your favourite holiday place. The local lingo is the most popular."The app is freely available, but looking at international trends there are ways to gain an income from the app and we will be exploring those ideas."Our view is that people are looking for easier and faster ways to say what they need to say while on the go. International research shows that communicating with emojis is the fastest-growing language in history."We are just putting a South African spin to it," said Erasmus.
