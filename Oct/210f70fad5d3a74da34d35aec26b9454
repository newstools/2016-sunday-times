Instead, the paper descended into far-fetched conspiracy theories to perplexingly conclude that the crucial three-day lekgotla, held to reinvigorate and strengthen the movement's work in parliament, represented some sort of a "quiet revolt" by "the anti-Zuma faction" ("ANC changes tune on Nkandla, Thuli", October 9).Nothing could be further from the truth.When the media creates illusionary strife where it does not exist, accuracy becomes a casualty and the opportunity to factually inform is lost. MPs shout down Mthembu criticIn candidly assessing the ANC's performance and the negative perceptions bedevilling the movement, the lekgotla was unanimous that, henceforth, things ought to be done differently in parliament.The majority party must learn from its mistakes and self-correct in order to reaffirm itself as a dependable, trustworthy and accountable force to intensify the project of liberating South Africa from poverty, unemployment and inequality.That the handling of Nkandla matter presented valuable lessons is a matter on which the ANC not only broadly pronounced. It also welcomed the Constitutional Court judgment as a valuable guide.The description by the Sunday Times of ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu's reassertion of this view - in the context of the lekgotla discussion on bolstering the ANC's parliamentary oversight and performance - as "part of a strategy by an anti-Zuma faction" is grossly misleading and unnecessarily sensationalist.It is inconceivable that the majority party in parliament would sit for three days in a midterm lekgotla for sheer "factional" strategy, as is suggested in the report.The only strategic approach that the chief whip and the lekgotla were preoccupied with was ensuring that the ANC puts its majority - and its excellent policies - to good use by advancing superior arguments to advance meaningful executive oversight that ensures significant impact on the lives of the people.Faltering in this resolve is tantamount to outsourcing our parliamentary mandate to the opposition or needlessly inviting the courts to baby-sit parliament. ANC MPs break ranks at caucusThe narrative that the ANC is soft on corruption and allows wrongdoing and maladministration to go unpunished is reputational damage that ANC-driven parliamentary oversight must undo, and be seen to be undoing, without fear or favour.The ANC has begun reinforcing its oversight by bolstering its research and legal professional support, toughening up on discipline and strengthening committee work.The recent alterations in the constitution of the communications portfolio committee is thus part of strengthening committees by harnessing the strengths and competencies of our MPs to maximise oversight outcomes. It has nothing to do with the alleged posture of MPs on certain issues, as spuriously inferred by the paper.The unanimous consensus emerging from the lekgotla is that it shall no longer be business as usual; the ANC in parliament must, in word and deed, regain the moral high ground, vigorously advance clean governance, champion the fight against corruption and shun incompetence.Ethical moral uprightness, informed by the constitution and the progressive laws which are the creation of this movement, shall serve as the guiding principle of our oversight.Moloto Mothapo is the ANC caucus spokesman
