Skhosana called on former coaches who had mentored greats to help build a new generation of stars.He said the executive's mandate was to ensure national teams performed well at the Olympic Games, Commonwealth Games, African championships and other competitions."We have been elected for nothing else... People expect more medals at the world championships [in London next year]... at Tokyo 2020." Olympics cost 'too high'Skhosana said a paramount issue was preparing athletes at home instead of losing talent overseas.South Africa had the facilities - especially at universities in Pretoria, Potchefstroom, Bloemfontein and Stellenbosch - which attracted top foreign athletes to train, especially in the northern hemisphere winter.He referred to the men's 4x100m relay team which had insufficient opportunities to qualify for Rio.Skhosana promised to send a "formidable team" to compete at the World Relays in the Bahamas.He pointed to the health of the sport, mentioning that two 18-year-old schoolboys qualified for the Rio Olympics, both in the 200m.But he didn't talk about the non-selection of Akani Simbine in that event, where he would likely have been a medal contender in Brazil.Skhosana was re-elected along with the board that was voted in two years ago after the federation was paralysed by boardroom infighting and facing a threat of bankruptcy."ASA was in a mess and corporates were sceptical."He said ASA's finances had improved in that time; the federation had achieved tax clearance from SARS and was close to settling a multimillion-rand debt to injured pole vaulter Jan Blignaut."We are almost about to finish that. I think by April next year," he said.Skhosana was confident that ASA was now sufficiently stable to attract sponsors in the future.
