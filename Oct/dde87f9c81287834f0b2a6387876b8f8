The retailer, which sells outdoor apparel and clothing, leisurewear, homeware products and footwear through its Cape Union Mart, Old Khaki, Poetry and Tread+Miller stores, has bought the full rights to the brand from Nelia Annandale, who founded Keedo 23 years ago.Cape Union Mart CEO Andr Labuschaigne said the purchase of Keedo was an attempt to diversify the company's retail offering, as it had not extensively covered the children's market. Although Cape Union Mart's K-Way brand includes children's clothing, Keedo will be the group's first stand-alone store offering.Commenting on the possibility of buying more children's brands, Labuschaigne said: "We'll expand Keedo ... we want to focus on Keedo and make it successful."It's a perfect culture fit. They will operate independently with our inputs, but it won't interfere with the day-to-day business and it gives us economies of scale. They also have their own factory and we feel strongly about local manufacturing."Keedo, which has 25 outlets, will add to the group's retail footprint of 216 stores. TFG takes first step in East African expansion"We are looking to expand the brand, as there is a lot of potential. We are going to upgrade the look and feel of the stores. We'll have 27 by the end of the year," Labuschaigne said.Although he was not prepared to comment on the financial performance of the two privately-owned companies, Labuschaigne said the Keedo management team had consistently produced double-digit growth "and there is potential for double-digit growth for a long time".As part of the acquisition, Cape Union Market will also take on Keedo's debt.Labuschaigne, who would not disclose how much debt Cape Union Mart had incurred as part of the acquisition, said: "We can safely say that Cape Union Mart is debt adverse."We've got a lazy balance sheet, we are pretty conservative when it comes to brands."The group now employs more than 2800 people."We'll grow responsibly but at a fast pace - there is so much potential that landlords are contacting us every day to offer new premises. We will grow at an aggressive speed."Labuschaigne said the 83-year-old retail group had no plans to list on the JSE, "but after Dis-Chem has listed we will be the biggest unlisted retailer in South Africa."We started Old Khaki and Poetry from nothing ... so we seem to know how to start a chain and create a brand."tshandup@sundaytimes.co.za
