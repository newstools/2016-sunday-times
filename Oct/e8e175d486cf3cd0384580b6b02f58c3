1) When buying a home, look out for properties which do not have large portions "missing" from the shape of the house. Irregularly shaped houses can lead to a weak underlying energy field that could bring about some type of challenge, depending on where the missing space is.2) When in doubt, go with cream-coloured floors in tile, screed or wood. As it is neutral in application, it creates elemental balance.3) Ensure the northeast area of your house is clutter free and has no fire colours like red. The underlying energy field of this zone is related to your mind and your ability to make clear decisions, to be focused and have innovative ideas.4) In the north of your home avoid fire colours like red, in wallpaper, curtains, carpets or paint. It can disturb the energy field which is responsible for career, finance and business opportunities.
