According to the Guardian, the militias have seized control of the central Rixos hotel, which houses the government's state council.The plotters issued a statement saying that the coup was an "historic initiative to rescue Libya". However the presidency, asserting that it remained in control, ordered the arrest of the plotters.With the militias led by former prime minister Khalifa al-Ghwell, the two sides confronted each other at the Rixos with forces loyal to the Government of National Accord pulling back.Supporters of the coup appeared to have gained control of the Rixos complex.The political situation has been unstable in Libya, despite the UN ordering an orderly handover of power to a unity government headed by Fayez al-Sarraj in March.It had been hoped the deal, brokered by the UN last December, would enable the establishment of a government of national unity.However, last month forces from the elected parliament in Tobruk, which is hostile to the authorities in Tripoli, captured four key oil ports.Muammar Gaddafi's regime was deposed, with Nato help, in 2011.
