The Cheetahs went through the entire pool phase without a blemish, winning eight out of eight, and they simply continued that form into what was a potentially tough semifinal and will host next weekend's final.The Lions suffered without half the team that won the title last season, but even so, the Cheetahs are a unit made up of up-and-comers, journeymen and the odd star and shouldn't have trampled the Lions so easily.They also had to overcome two second-half yellow cards - to centre Rayno Benjamin and flank Paul Schoeman for repeated infringements and a dangerous tackle respectively - but by then the job was done.Free State led 26-0 at half time and by the time Benjamin received his yellow, they led 33-0. There was no way back for the Lions with more than half-an-hour to play.Marais, who played Varsity Cup a year ago, contributed 21 points from a perfect eight shots at goal while Petersen added two tries.The Free State pack was excellent, and scrumhalf Shaun Venter fleet-footed and decisive behind it, which gave Petersen a good platform from which to sprinkle his stardust.Petersen repaid coach Franco Smith's faith in recalling him to the starting lineup after injury with a buzzing performance that included two first-half tries and another late in the game for a superb hat-trick.When Petersen burst on the scene as a teenager playing for the Kings in the 2013 Super Rugby, it was obvious he had something special.Injuries have hindered his progress, but against the Lions he showed that he still has pace, which he has complemented with a high work rate. It wouldn't be a surprise to see him on tour with the Boks in the UK and Italy next month.Free State went into the game unbeaten, but Smith couldn't have wished for a better opening stanza.The pack were excellent in the loose too, with flank Uzair Cassiem and hooker Torsten van Jaarsveld particularly prominent.It was a lovely "no-look" pass from Cassiem that sent Petersen on his way for the first try in the 15th minute.Van Jaarsveld's tackle on Kwagga Smith dislodged the ball deep inside Cheetahs' territory, and from the hack ahead by lock Reniel Hugo, Petersen was away for his second try.When Free State No8 Niell Jordaan scored his team's third try less than a minute into the second half after a Petersen break out, the match was over as a contest.The Lions benefited when replacement Cheetahs centre Rayno Benjamin was yellow-carded for repeated infringements by scoring through wing Sylvian Mahuza.The hosts rammed their dominance home with further tries to Benjamin and fullback Clayton Blommetjies.SCORERSCheetahs 55 - Tries: Sergeal Petersen (3), Niell Jordaan, Rayno Benjamin, Clayton Blommetjies Conversions: Niel Marais (3), Fred Zeilinga (2).
