This Mampara was to later find himself on the wrong side of the law after he and others were allegedly paid R2.5-million for a concert by R&amp;B sensation RKelly that never was.Now he is in the news again, this time for allegedly attacking a fellow councillor during a sitting of the Nelson Mandela Bay metro council with a glass water jug.Such thuggery should not be condoned and this Mampara should have long ago been barred from public office for his past transgressions.That Lungisa - instead of showing remorse - tried to spin his way out of trouble is evidence that this Mampara is not fit for any office.
