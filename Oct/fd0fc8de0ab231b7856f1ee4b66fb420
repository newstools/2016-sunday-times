Community safety mayoral committee member Anniruth "Derrick" Kissonduth wants the council and mayor Solly Msimanga to approve the removal of the metro police from presidential escorts.Kissonduth told the Sunday Times the move would save the metro between R20-million and R30-million a year.The Tshwane metro police escort Zuma and Ramaphosa when they travel by road in Gauteng and surrounding provinces.In Pictures: Blood as chaos erupts at NMB council meetingWhen Msimanga took over he threatened to ban blue-light convoys in the capital, saying only Zuma would be allowed them. It later emerged that the municipality had no authority over who can or cannot make use of the blue lights.This latest move is expected to fuel further tension in a council that has already seen ANC councillors exchange blows with those from the DA and EFF. Chaos ensued on Thursday as ANC councillors interrupted a council meeting several times.Similar disruptions were reported in the Johannesburg and Nelson Mandela Bay metro councils. In the latter, two councillors were taken to hospital after a scuffle between the ANC and smaller parties.Reports suggest that police have cellphone footage showing ANC councillor Andile Lungisa assaulting DA councillor Rano Kayser.The fracas ended when a shot went off, allegedly fired by a security guard.Kissonduth - who is an ACDP councillor and part of the DA-led coalition government - said the withdrawal of metro police from Zuma's convoy was motivated by cost saving."It is also not part of our mandate [to escort Zuma]. It is the mandate of the VIP Protection Unit to protect and escort the president," he said.The move is one of many introduced by the DA-led administration since taking over the running of the city. These include a ban on municipal parties and gala dinners and on overseas trips by the executive.Mashaba stands down from threat to pull Joburg out of bloated SalgaIt appears the protection unit has acquired motorcyclists to escort the president's motorcade. Several were seen outside Luthuli House last week, directing traffic in anticipation of the president's arrival.Answering questions on behalf of the protection unit, police Brigadier Mashadi Selepe said disclosing details of Zuma's security detail would compromise his security."The deployment of resources including the motorbikes are informed by the need to ensure the execution of the protection and security services mandate," she said.Selepe, however, also responded to detailed questions by saying: "The allegations made through the media on the security detail of the president are baseless and uninformed."Controversy around the Tshwane metro police escort surfaced in January 2014, when it emerged that the metro spent R500,000 to escort Zuma and his then deputy, Kgalema Motlanthe, to attend an ANC birthday bash.The request for the escort allegedly came from the police's presidential protection service.Since then, metro police motorcyclists have accompanied Zuma on travels even out of the capital city and were seen as a gesture of goodwill from former mayor Kgosientso Ramokgopa.hunterq@sundaytimes.co.za
