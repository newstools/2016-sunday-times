It would be easy to overlook Fermier, tucked away as it is at the back of the Lynnwood property on which it stands, its discreet look combining Scandinavian log cabin and rural African mud hut.Most of the restaurant and adjacent buildings, where much of the produce they serve at Fermier is grown and cultivated, were designed in a low-impact, low-budget style.Adriaan Maree (ex Rust en Vrede, Roots and Hibiscus in London) is the man who is not only trying to create a fully sustainable restaurant, but is also the chef behind the stove. The restaurant is mostly constructed of raw, untreated materials, and has minimal mod cons.Restaurant review: Steak tastic, PretoriaMaree says he was slightly worried about the winter cold, but dealt with it by just making bigger fires in the fireplaces connected to flues that run under the floor. Fermier got through its first winter victoriously, showing us that it is possible to operate a business with negligible environmental impact.The large swivel doors allow the familiar Pretoria bushveld atmosphere to gently roll in. The restaurant consists of one large room with an open-plan kitchen. Right outside the front door, the lady in charge of the scullery does some gardening to generate additional income, thus providing the restaurant with broad beans, peas and parsnips.And that is what makes this restaurant so special: the basic ground-level sustainability concept that allows all employees to increase their independence.Adjoining the restaurant is an aquaponics project consisting of various ponds holding around 2,000 tilapia each. The fish are raised on duckweed, releasing nutrients into the water to feed the vegetables used in the restaurant.The terraced wooden planting troughs, which allow gravity to facilitate the flow of water, produce everything from edible flowers such as pansies, nasturtiums and borage (not necessarily Maree's favourite plating items) to artichokes, asparagus, lettuce, watercress, celery, basil, tomatoes, green peppers, pumpkins, strawberries and other berries. They also farm pigs, geese and ducks, which regularly feature on the menu.Fermier offers only a set menu which consists mostly of five or more courses, although Maree envisages a minimum of seven courses for the new season. Like most believers in treading lightly on the surface of our planet he tries to minimise waste, so the parts of the tilapia not served to patrons are used to make stock for bouillabaisse and dressings. Restaurant review: The Rose Kitchen, PretoriaThe menu announces different courses quite starkly by emphasising the main ingredients - for example "quail", "duck egg", "seabass", "lamb". Fermier offers a homemade charcuterie plate as a first arrivals course, and quite often this is paired with a specific wine; on a previous visit we enjoyed delicious duck rillettes served in a little jar with deliciously crusty bread.The quail dish is served with celeriac, radicchio, hazelnut and coffee, paired with Spioenkop riesling. The duck egg that follows is cleverly combined with goat's cheese, green soup (made with watercress grown next door), verjus and beurre noisette. The seabass is a fantastic extravaganza with mussels, scallops, cauliflower, apple, avocado and celery, followed by two separate courses of lamb.In the first, red pepper, spinach, onion, lemon and olives combine with the lamb for a lighter, almost Mediterranean touch; while aubergine, cabbage, fennel and grapefruit accompany the second course.Buttermilk, chocolate, vanilla and rosehip are the other flavours rounding out the dessert that is simply described as "jasmine and Earl Grey".Much has been written about humanity's impact on the planet and how we should aim to feed ourselves with integrity and a conscience. We could all take a page out of the Fermier book.The delight of serving a packed restaurant with food grown on site, albeit through some effort, could only help to strengthen the philosophy of touching the earth as lightly as possible.
