Johnson also claimed some players did not want to play for Australia under Clarke, who retired from international cricket after losing the Ashes last year.The 73-test bowler, who was one of four players banned amid the "Homework-gate" saga during the ill-fated tour of India in 2013, suggested the Australian team was fractured after Clarke took over the captaincy from Ricky Ponting in 2011."The dynamics definitely changed," Johnson told Fox Sports News Australia. "It wasn't a team. There were different little factions going on and it was very toxic. We plot five differences between SA teams who lost in Oz and those who've won"It just built very slowly, but everyone could see it, everyone could feel it and nothing was being done."So it wasn't a very enjoyable place to be and you're supposed to be enjoying yourself when you're playing for your country."It was a pretty bad experience, bad time, a couple of us didn't want to play. Even some of the young guys coming through could see it a mile away and they didn't enjoy it. They said: 'State cricket's so much more fun'."Johnson said his relationship with Clarke had been tarnished after his ban for failing to do his homework during the 2013 India tour."I didn't take it too well," he said. "I guess the relationship was pretty strained within the team - I definitely felt like an outsider."Johnson is the latest on a growing list of Clarke's former Australia teammates to hit out at his leadership after the release of the 35-year-old's biography this month.Clarke admitted in a TV interview that the behaviour of some players during the 2013 tour of England was "like a tumour".Australia coach Mickey Arthur was sacked just days before that Ashes series, and in subsequent legal documents it was reported he had claimed Clarke had described his former vice-captain Shane Watson as a "cancer" on the team."For me I think it was more a reflection of the person he is more than what it was directed towards me," Watson said last week. Under the proposal, a 13-team league would replace current scheduling, with each country playing a total of 12 matches per year in each format Former opener Simon Katich also cast doubt on some of Clarke's claims about their well-publicised dressing-room altercation at the Sydney Cricket Ground in 2009, saying that he was "obviously trying to sell a book".Clarke did enjoy seminal moments of success as Australia captain, most significantly the 2013/14 Ashes whitewash - when Johnson was the star turn - while he also led the 2015 World Cup success.On both occasions his vice-captain was Brad Haddin, who backed Clarke's leadership in a column on Cricinfo this week: "Watson had a difficult time as Michael's deputy because they did not have the same open relationship to discuss things that I was fortunate to have.Michael was a very good tactical captain who was always in control on the field." Oz cricket looks at player fatigue Cricket Australia (CA) is throwing its support behind a radical plan to restructure the scheduling of international one-day and Twenty20 matches to address concerns over the number of matches players are required to play.Under the proposal, a 13-team league would replace current scheduling, with each country playing a total of 12 matches per year in each format.CA chief James Sutherland said the move would create more certainty around the amount of cricket being played."That means you play six one-day matches away, six one-day matches at home every year," Sutherland said.It would mean the Australian cricket team would play less cricket on a yearly basis, while others would play more frequently than currently scheduled. Sutherland added that any change would not affect the prestige of series such as the Ashes. abc.net.au
