When and why did you start Room 13 Collection?We've actually been in business since 2003 as Room 13 Design, a studio in Cape Town that specialises in graphic design and art direction.We started Room 13 Collection three years ago, as a move into interior products such as wallpaper, textiles and soft furnishings. It's been a natural progression from being designers to wanting to create products for our own homes, especially as our mom is also an interior decorator.Describe your brand in three words.Creative, passionate, detail-driven.What are you working on now?Our second textile and wallpaper collection. When we are not working on designs for the Collection, we design corporate identities for clients.</img>The Room 13 Collection brand includes textiles, wallpapers and soft furnishings.
