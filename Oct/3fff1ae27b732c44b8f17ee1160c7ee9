Q: I am a single woman in my 40s who is interested in someone as a partner but not on a permanent basis. I don't want to feel tied down. Can a non-exclusive relationship work?A: Many people are now talking about and opting for "non-exclusive" relationships. Society in general appears to be more willing to discuss and accept these types of relationships.Non-exclusive relationships, or what are sometimes referred to as open relationships, have a better chance of working if everyone involved agrees in advance without coercion, and if the rules of engagement are clearly spelt out. Is it unhealthy not to cuddle after sex?One detail people often fail to discuss is the opt-out procedure when the arrangement goes wrong.Some of the arrangements may include:"Ongoing booty call" - where you contact each other only for sex;"Friends with benefits" - a no-strings deal between people who hang out as friends and have sex too; and"Serial dating" - going on dates, which may or may not include sex, with different people.The benefit of a pre-agreed non-exclusive relationship is that you can date or have protected sex with other people and not feel like you owe your other partner an explanation or that you are living a lie. But it is difficult to predict if it will work for you.Jealousy, resentment and feelings of low self-esteem or low self-worth can creep in even with people who may have thought they had mastered the art of "sharing".
