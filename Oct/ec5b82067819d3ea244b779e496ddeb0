The Real Madrid superstar was making his first appearance for Portugal since he was stretchered off injured and in tears from the final of Euro 2016 and he wasted no time in making up for his three-month absence from international football.The 31-year-old took 73 seconds to make his mark. He was wrestled to the floor at a corner but then jumped up to volley in left footed from around the penalty spot after the Andorra goalkeeper could only parry a header.Ronaldo, who has struggled to get back to his best for Real since knee trouble, was at it again two minutes later when he was left totally unmarked on the six-yard box to rise and head in.It was only a matter of how many for the home side after that, as Portugal belatedly got three points on the board in Group B, after losing in Switzerland in their opening group match.Ronaldo made it the perfect hat-trick just 90 seconds after the break, grabbing his third - Portugal's fourth - with a sweet right-footed volley.Andorra's evening got worse just after the hour when they went down to 10 men, Jordi Rubio receiving a second yellow card for clattering late and hard into Ronaldo, who punished the visitors with another half-volley.Cynical and increasingly desperate Andorra saw red again when Marc Rebes was the next to get sent off, again for cutting down Ronaldo.Andre Silva sealed the punishment four minutes from time."We know that Switzerland and the Faroes won tonight and it will be necessary to beat them during qualification," said Ronaldo, who now has 65 international goals."There are eight games left and we want to win them all to reach the World Cup finals." The Swiss scored in the 89th minute to top Group B, Valentin Stocker firing them to a 3-2 away win in Hungary for six points from six.France, agonisingly beaten by Portugal in Paris in the Euro final in July, returned to the scene of that heartbreak and got off to the worst possible start when they conceded after just six minutes at the Stade de France.Mihail Aleksandrov stroked in from the penalty spot to give the Bulgarians a shock lead in a very competitive-looking Group A.But the French stormed back with two goals from Kevin Gameiro - making his first international start in almost five years - in a convincing 4-1 win.Under-achieving Belgium also enjoyed a fine home win, Eden Hazard scoring a beauty in the first period as they defeated Bosnia and Herzegovina 4-0 to go top of Group H.
