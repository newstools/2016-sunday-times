It's sure to be lively in Manchester this season, with Mourinho and Zlatan Ibrahimovic up against their nemesis, Pep Guardiola. Can Mourinho restore United to their former glories? Today's match against Bournemouth at the Vitality Stadium will go some way to answering that question.In Ibrahimovic, United have brought in a player with bags of experience and ridiculously high expectations that his teammates should strive to meet. He should also do something to improve on United's awful goal tally from last season.Paul Pogba is one of the best players in the world with the potential to get even better. He will likely finally solve the midfield problem United have suffered for a decade and should provide the quality the team has been crying out for in this area of the pitch.But the Red Devils will be without their record 89-million signing today and will have to wait for his debut after the FA said the France international has been suspended for the opening weekend.Pogba's suspension has been carried over from Juventus' Italian Cup campaign last season where he picked up bookings in the semifinal against Inter Milan and the final victory over AC Milan.Henrikh Mkhitaryan was the best player in Germany last season who, if he adjusts well to the Premier League, could be the creative force United desperately need. With quality attacking players to provide for, the Armenian should really enjoy himself in the season ahead.Finally, Eric Bailly has the makings of a fantastic centre-half who, like Mkhitaryan, could be hugely influential if he adapts well from La Liga. His man-of-the-match performance against Jamie Vardy in the Community Shield was a good indication of what he is capable of.
