Days after losing their title as the world's top test team, the reigning champions in 50-over cricket will be determined to stop the rot when they take to the field in the first of five ODIs against an upbeat Sri Lanka.Angelo Mathews' side completed a 3-0 series whitewash over the tourists this week when they won the final test in Colombo by 163 runs, a result which led to Australia being toppled by India at the top of the rankings. Pace pair's return lifts South African spiritsAustralian captain Steve Smith admitted they had been totally outclassed after failing to come to terms with the turning Sri Lankan wickets, both with bat and ball.While Smith remains at the helm of the ODI side, the squad will be bolstered by one-day specialists such as allrounders Aaron Finch and James Faulkner, along with young spinner Adam Zampa.Mitchell Marsh, who was earlier named in the ODI squad, was released after the test series and his place in the starting lineup is expected to be taken by another allrounder, Moises Henriques.Coach Darren Lehmann said Australia had "obviously got some quality allrounders in our one-day squad" and the decision to release Marsh meant he could recharge his batteries before next month's tour to South Africa.Sri Lanka will meanwhile be looking to take their new-found confidence into the limited-overs series, with Mathews insisting that there would be no room for complacency after the test triumph."We have the ODI series left and we will try and concentrate on that," said Mathews.Sri Lanka, who saw four of their top fast bowlers suffer injuries on a recent tour of England, now have Nuwan Pradeep and Suranga Lakmal, who played the final test in Colombo, back in contention."When you play ODIs you need to have at least two fast bowlers," said Mathews, who played a single fast bowler in the three tests.Today's match is the first of two games in Colombo before the contest continues with two matches in Dambulla and wraps up in Pallekele on September 4.
