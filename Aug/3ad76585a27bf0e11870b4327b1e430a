Marianne Fassler was probably one of our favourite designer showcases of the evening. Her collection featured a-line skirts, cargo prints, cut-out shoulder detailing and a whole mix of colour.

Live music wins our best vote for entertainment any day!Another interesting bonus in Marianne s showcase was the contemporary dancer who opened the show. The dancer came onto the runway, in a skin-tight leotard that sported arbitrary patterns. As the show went on, the dancer stood to the side of the runway swaying with her hands and legs from side to side. Stefania Morland s show was another favourite last night. The designer wowed the crowd as classic music played in the background while the models walked the ramp in full ruffled a-line dresses. The ruffled looks reminded us of giant beautiful cakes.

Nhlanhla Nciza showcased her collection with the help of live music artists. In a gorgeous showcase of pinks, her collection featured shades ranging from baby pink all the way to bright pink in velvet textures.

The bopping models made the collection seem fun and vibrant. Hoorah, we cant wait for day 3!
