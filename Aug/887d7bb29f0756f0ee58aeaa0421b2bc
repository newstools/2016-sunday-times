The Ghosts will have nightmares of Ovono's two butterfingered blunders that gifted Bidvest Wits an easy passage into the MTN8 semifinals.It was the kind of performance that will see psychologists making a killing in terms of treating fans who want to forget his mistakes quickly. Their silence when exiting the stadium was deafening.If his 38th-minute howler to let Buhle Mkhwanazi's innocuous header somehow creep over the line was not enough, his 76th-minute gaffe that allowed Thulani Hlatshwayo an easy tap-in took the cake.The 23-year-old Equatoguinean should have collected Thabang Monare's speculative long-range shot, but with the way his evening panned out, he wouldn't have been relied on to catch a comet if the planet's fate was at stake.With quality keepers in Brighton Mhlongo and Jackson Mabokgwane in the stands and on the bench respectively, head coach Muhsin Ertugral's experiment has to come to an end. After all, it was Ovono's error on Wednesday evening that allowed Golden Arrows an equaliser they did not deserve.The Pirates faithful outnumbered the Wits supporters 10 to one in the stands, but Bidvest Stadium is no longer a haunt Soweto teams enjoy.Kaizer Chiefs were the victims on Tuesday, showcasing Wits' giant-killing ability. If last season's league double is included, Wits have beaten Pirates in three consecutive games.Ovono's performance yesterday liquefied the platform the midfielders had painstakingly laid in the process of building up for the first goal.The ease in which they sliced open Wits' defence on the way to the penalty conceded by Hlatshwayo for his foul on Thabo Matlaba was indicative of the step up in quality Wits were facing. The 16th-minute penalty was easily converted by captain Oupa Manyisa, who is easing himself in after recovering from a broken leg that kept him out for the better part of last season.What was evident was that the hosts were no mugs, even though their midweek party tricks were easily countered.While these sides were unfortunately scheduled to meet early in the season, it shouldn't come as a surprise if they are contesting league honours come the end of the season.While the loss may not have done them justice, the Buccaneers were a far better side than Steve Komphela's rabble bunch, who snoozed their way through their distinctly forgettable 2-1 defeat on Tuesday.Pirates will be smarting after the loss but they have a lot more positives to work on. They will be a difficult team to beat if they pick the right goalkeeper.Their midfield group, led by Manyisa, was impressive, while centreback Abbubaker Mobara shook off early nerves. However, they met their match in Monare and Xola Mlambo, who were unflinchingly efficient.The number of misplaced passes and lost second balls may have displeased the late Ted "The Professor" Dumitru, but it did not detract from the quality of the game.Wednesday's hat-trick hero Tendai Ndoro had a quiet game but should have had the beating of the upright in the 47th minute when his shot from an excellent run screamed past the advancing Moeneeb Josephs.Zimbabwean international Ndoro also had another chance in the 74th minute but he somehow skied his shot. It was a sign of what was to come two minutes later as Ovono's blunder gifted the hosts the lead.The stuffing was knocked out of the visitors as the tournament will have to proceed without the Soweto giants. Football can be strange and beautiful like that.In the earlier quarterfinal at the Royal Bafokeng Stadium, goals by Rhulani Manzini and Menzi Masuku, either side of half time, helped Chippa United to a deserved 2-0 win against Platinum Stars. Manzini profited from lax defending to score the opener in the ninth minute while Masuku's 80th-minute goal settled matters.Bidvest Wits: 2Orlando Pirates: 1
