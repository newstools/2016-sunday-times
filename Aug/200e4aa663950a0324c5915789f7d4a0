The 20-minute show on Thursday to launch her NN Vintage line started with Khanyi Mbau performing her song Shake in an umbrella top and underwear, followed by actress Jessica Nkosi, TV personality Luthando "LootLove" Shosha, Big Brother Mzansistar Babalwa Mneno and Idols SA judge Somizi Mhlongo, among others.Nciza said she had wanted to move away from the stiff and serious ramp showcase to a more vibrant African show."I am an entertainer and a designer, which is what I wanted to showcase through my show.The Best of Mercedes Benz Fashion Week Johannesburg X AFI Day 3"I chose all sorts of shaped celebrities because I wanted to show support to other female celebrities, since it's Women's Month, while also showing my potential buyers that you don't have to be a skinny person to wear NN Vintage," she said.But there were a few glitches. One model was left exposed when her black top snapped as she walked the ramp, leaving her breasts in full view of the cameras and guests. Gasps turned into a cheer of encouragement when she appeared to be unfazed.A commentator on SABC show Trendz , Leroy Marc, said he felt Nciza should have done better as it wasn't her first fashion show."It was a good show, but there were so many elements that left me disturbed. Had the models not been dancing and moving about as much as they were, those garments could have survived the runaway."Her use of peplum has been done to death and is not flattering to the African [figure]," he said.Another model stepped on her long mesh skirt and the audience watched in dismay as it slowly ripped."Getting on stage anything can happen, unfortunately. That is life but I am glad the model handled it really well," said Nciza.But designer Gavin Rajah said local fashion shows left much to be desired. "There is a huge discussion in the fashion industry at the moment, where many are asking if shows are targeted for a fashion audience or are put on for entertainment."
