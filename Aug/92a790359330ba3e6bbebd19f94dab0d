With New Zealand bombing out early, the road was paved for Fiji to win the gold medal.They are a nation who thrive on performing on the big stage and leaving a calling card when it counts the most.Their impeccable record at the Hong Kong Sevens had to be an indication of how they often turn it when it is required.As for Neil Powell's side, their third place is indicative of a year where finishing third has become a norm. This was the case at the Hong Kong, US and Singapore Sevens tournaments in the 2015-16 Sevens World Series where they were unable to get past the semifinals. They finished second overall behind Fiji.Maybe the heartbreaking 7-5 semifinal defeat to Great Britain saved the side from what could have been an embarrassing final defeat.A 43-7 final scoreline is a commanding one in any form of rugby, let alone an Olympic Gold Medal match.While senior players like Werner Kok and Cecil Afrika revelled in the honour of collecting an Olympic medal, the feeling of underperformance will always linger.Like the men's cricket team, they seemed to relish playing without pressure, evident in their 54-14 caning of Japan.Having won the Commonwealth Games sevens gold medal two years ago, more was expected of them, especially with the noted excellence of South African rugby teams at international tournaments.Kok knew the level of competition and the stakes would be higher in the Olympics than in the 2014 Commonwealth Games but felt the team acquitted itself very well."Things have been different here and it's a step up from the Commonwealth Games. They've brought out something different here. I think if Sevens rugby can hold sway at the Olympic Games, it would be phenomenal.It gives the other nations a chance of achieving something bigger and something that would not normally come to them in the 15s version," Kok said."In the Japan game, we didn't make it bigger than it was and we played to our processes. We did the basics right and the guys got stuck in and wanted to prove that we're a quality team."
