Sandton Square was decorated not only by the massive Fashion Week tent which had a floral theme throughout but also by many Fashionista s making their way to the fashion scene. One of our favourite street style looks of the evening was this lovely lady:Bontlefeela Mogoye (Instagram: @bontle_feela)We especially loved her take on styling this Zara jacket with a colourful range of pom-poms. FAVOURITE SHOW: Maxwell Boko who was one of The Interns that participated in 'The Intern by David Tlale.' His collection featured bright blue and green fabric that was fused together and created the shape of a women's silhouette. TRACK OF THE EVENING: Dead in the Water by Ellie Goulding. This relaxed track featured as part of The Intern by David Tlale as the models walked down the ramp. Listen to it hear: ANOTHER FAVOURITE: Colour by Nandi Mngoma and Inga Madyibi. The range featured colourful spring/summer dresses with string sleeves that made us wish winter to be over already. Contrary to the name of the collection, some of the looks featured on the runway were monochromatic in colour. BEAUTY REGIME: The models walked down the runway with flawless and minimal base make up, their colourful face paint illuminated. We loved the touch of face paint which matched the theme of the show: "Colour." MOST EXCITING MOMENT: When Nandi walked the stage she showed off a cute baby bump. Congratulations Nandi! What an exciting way to end off the show and your first collection preview.If the first night of Fashion Week was anything to go by we can easily say that the rest of the week is going to be full of excitement and gorgeous fashion. Stay tuned.
