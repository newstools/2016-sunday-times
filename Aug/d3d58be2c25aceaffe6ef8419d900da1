Such was their pace, panache and ability to execute skills at high intensity, they made Michael Cheika's side look distinctly ordinary as the rampant New Zealanders inflicted further pain on Australia after last weekend's 42-8 rout ensured they retained the Bledisloe Cup for another year.The Wallabies stayed in touch in the first half, with the All Blacks only 15-9 up, but were kept scoreless in the second half as the All Blacks added a further 14 points of the second-round Rugby Championship clash.This victory makes the third test in October a dead rubber.The Bledisloe Cup is billed as the symbol of trans-Tasman rivalry, but it has been all one-way traffic since 2002 when it was last held by Australia.In two tests this month the world champion All Blacks have scored 10 tries against one.But, unlike the first test, when the All Blacks were in command from the start, they did not have it all their own way for the first 46 minutes of the rematch.Israel Dagg scored two tries with Julian Savea and Sam Cane also dotting down while Beauden Barrett landed three conversions and a penalty for the All Blacks.The Wallabies points came from two Bernard Foley penalties and one by Reece Hodge.For most of the game, the sublime flavour from a week ago was replaced by a scrappy, sour performance as the Wallabies, as expected, began with considerable intent.Amid the feisty start they claimed two turnovers in the first four minutes, but for all their endeavour and vastly improved line speed they made little headway.Instead, their improvement on attack gave way to a struggling set piece, losing their own ball at crucial times, and their defence also let them down.Aaron Smith and Beauden Barrett took turns at carving through the defensive wall to set up Dagg for the All Blacks' two first-half tries.Their path forward was made easier by a one-man advantage as a result of the Wallabies' decision to keep flyhalf Quade Cooper away from the frontline.Australia relied on the three first-half penalties, with Hodge - who came on for his test debut when Ashley Adam-Cooper left the field with concussion - landing a booming 55m effort.There was considerable niggle in the first half which only settled down just before half time when referee Roman Poite tired of issuing warnings and sent Wallabies lock Adam Coleman to the sin-bin for a late charge on Ben Smith.Dagg, who relished the move to the right wing, set up the first try in the second half when he beat Quade Cooper in the air for the All Blacks to swing the ball to the other side of the field where Savea scored in the corner.Cane bagged the All Blacks' fourth try after Ben Smith sliced through the Wallabies backs with 19 minutes remaining.Though the All Blacks did not score again they spent most of the time in Wallabies territory and missed three possible tries through handling errors.Both sides now have a week off in the Rugby Championship before the All Blacks face Argentina in Hamilton on September 10. The Wallabies play South Africa in Brisbane on the same day.All Blacks skipper Kieran Reed, in accepting the Bledisloe Cup, was modest in his summary of the game: "It was a true Bledisloe test," he said kindly. "The [Australians] stuck at it tonight and made us work really hard ... It was never going to be the same [as last week], but we were fortunate to get some tries in the second half."SCORERSNew Zealand 29 - Tries: Israel Dagg (2), Julian Savea, Sam Cane.
