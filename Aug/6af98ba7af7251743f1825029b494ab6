The dynamic All Blacks embarrassed the Wallabies, holders of the title, six tries to one and have now lost only once to the Australians in their last 14 encounters.It was Australia's fifth straight test defeat after losing to the All Blacks 34-17 in last October's World Cup final along with three defeats at home to Six Nations champions England in June.The Kiwis appear no closer to giving up the Bledisloe Cup they have held since 2003 with the remaining trans-Tasman tests at home in Wellington and Auckland. BOKS LEAVE IT LATEIf Australia thought the chance to finally master the Kiwi powerhouse had arrived after the retirement of legends Richie McCaw and Daniel Carter they were sadly mistaken.The Wallabies' hopes were shredded by a devastating opening half by the All Blacks, who smashed through porous defence for four tries to lead 32-3 at half time.The world champions dominated territory and possession with Australia seeming to be incapable of mounting any resistance to the incessant waves of attack.It got no better for the Australians with the Kiwis scoring a further 10 points against some flimsy defence.Bernard Foley kicked an early penalty goal for the Wallabies but the All Blacks hit back quickly in the sixth minute. Ryan Crotty broke through the tackles of Dane Haylett-Petty and Matt Giteau to storm over for an easy converted try.The Wallabies had another setback when Giteau was forced from the field hobbling on an injured left ankle to be replaced by Matt Toomua.Barrett kicked the All Blacks further in front with back-to-back penalties as the Wallabies struggled to get into the game.The hapless Wallabies called on a replacement for the replacement when Toomua collided with Barrett and made way for Rob Horne. Rugby Wayde's in with the hypeMore disaster befell the Wallabies when Foley's clearing kick was charged down by flanker Jerome Kaino, who scored for a 25-3 lead.Nothing was going right for the Wallabies with a third back forced off the field when Horne succumbed to a left-arm injury.The All Blacks showed no mercy and scored their fourth try through left-winger Waisake Naholo after a scything run by Barrett.The game looked well beyond the Wallabies' reach at half time after an explosive opening half by the world champions.Coach Michael Cheika made a flurry of replacements early in the second half in a bid to spark a fightback by his team as the All Blacks continued their points rampage.Dane Coles scored after Tevita Kuridrani dropped a pass and then minutes later another replacement, Julian Savea, scored in the opposite corner for a 42-3 lead.Replacement Nick Phipps scored the Wallabies' only try with five minutes left.SCORERSAustralia 8 - Try: Nick Phipps.
