It was a coming-of-age display from a youngster who fancied himself as a serviceable centre-forward before his conversion into a defensive midfielder/centreback at Ajax Cape Town.In that goalless draw at the Mane Garrincha National Stadium on August 4, the 22-year-old from Mitchells Plain found himself star struck before keeping the Barcelona forward on a tight leash.While it earned him rave reviews back in South Africa, the positive feedback from Spanish referee Antonio Mateu Lahoz gave him the most encouragement."Some people will say I got the better of Neymar and some will see differently, but that's football. You won't win every tackle and ball but I can never describe the feeling I had when I was marking Neymar," said Mobara. I couldn't stop looking at his boots. They alone just caught my attention but I never forgot my core job. I couldn't admire how he looks on the field but I had to do my job."It was difficult marking a player who is equally impressive off both feet because I couldn't force him into a corner. Neymar was that tactically good and the referee in that game congratulated me on marking him well without fouling him and congratulated the timing of my tackles."At half time the referee pulled me aside and said I must continue the good job because I wasn't coming close to fouling him."He added: "Before the game I prayed and hoped for the Almighty to guide me through the game because nothing is possible without Him."Mobara's three caps - earned in the successful Cosafa Cup conquest in early June - points to his relative lack of experience in a tightly contested facet within the Bafana Bafana squad. But, he seems to play with a heart filled with faith, with fear being foreign to him.With Bafana approaching a crucial juncture with the Fifa 2018 World Cup qualifiers just around the corner, trepidation cannot be part of his vocabulary.The competition within the squad and the lessons learnt in his Olympic sojourn serve as internal driving forces in his quest of becoming a better player and human being."In football there will always be competition and I don't want to be trapped in the comfort zone mindset," Mobara said."Once you're in that groove, you take the game for granted and you don't want to be pushed."Having competition is the best thing for a footballer because that drives you to become a better player. It adds to the hunger and the selfishness because I'm a footballer and what I do feeds my family. I can't be in a comfort zone"
