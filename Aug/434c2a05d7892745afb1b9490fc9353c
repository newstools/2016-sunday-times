Football, though, does not do sentimentalism. It does not even like to dwell too much on loyalty.It is ruthless, cold-hearted, merciless and driven by the same brutal, hard economics that have sent the cost of watching live football soaring beyond the reach of many low-income families. Tears are wasted on an industry like this.So what if Hart has been a cornerstone of City's two title triumphs? Who cares if it has often been his brilliance between the posts that has secured silverware or prevented humiliating exits from European competitions?Not when you are a club that has spent billions to become a major player in European football. Not when you have an ambition to become one of the most recognisable brands in global sport.Certainly not when you have managed to lure supposedly the best, most esteemed coach to oversee the final leap from domestic superpower to continental domination.Pep Guardiola, the most eulogised manager in world football, does not rate Hart - even if he has tried to claim otherwise with a vague promise to make him a better player if he does accept he is no longer first choice.On Thursday, City confirmed the signing of 33-year-old goalkeeper Claudio Bravo from La Liga giants Barcelona for a fee of 13.75-million.The Chilean international's arrival leaves Hart with five days to find a new club or be left stewing in City's reserves until at least January.Whether it was Hart's meltdown playing for England at the European Championships, or whether he is a potential source of resistance to the Spaniard's new methods, the 29-year-old has been demoted from first- to third-choice goalkeeper with a cruel dismissal of his ability.This is football. It does not matter if you have made 347 appearances for the club and your face has been used to help sell it to a new generation of armchair supporters, it is Pep's way or find yourself a way out. Hart's time is up. Tough, deal with it, move on.Except Hart is not being allowed to move on unless City get what they, rather than he, wants. They are entitled to do so, legally, of course.Hart has three years left on a contract worth 120000-a-week and he is a valuable asset. They are entitled to ask for a transfer fee or even one to loan him for a season.After all, footballers do not like to honour contracts when they get a better offer elsewhere or when they can't get on with their teammates.Footballers - and City have had a few of these since they became one of the richest clubs in the world - can refuse to move if they have a lucrative contract to help ease the disappointment of not playing first- team football.City are not breaking any rules in holding on to Hart until someone offers them enough money to sell him or an eye-watering 7-million just to loan him for one season.But surely they owe Hart something which has nothing to do with balance sheets and business plans?Hart has been a great goalkeeper for City, a rock behind an often leaky defence and a reassuring presence for supporters who have seen their club change from solid, reliable English underachievers into successful, aspirational globetrotters.City need to show Hart some heart. Guardiola's message is clear, but that is not Hart's fault and he should not be punished for it.- The Daily Telegraph, London
