Another gem of a hangout has hit inner-city Joburg, with the recent opening of the Mad Giant brewery and accompanying Urbanologi restaurant. With interiors and furniture by acclaimed designer Haldane Martin, the space is an ode to oversized metal toy construction kits, creating a fun, welcoming industrial space that's right at home in downtown Jozi. As you enter, you're welcomed by a 7m giant yeti, which forms the centrepiece of the cast concrete bar. All the furniture is bespoke, and includes a range of original pieces by Martin made from custom scaled-up Meccano. Every detail, from the tables to the floors and the lights, cheekily fits the theme, making this a whimsical creative space which speaks to Joburg's urban regeneration.www.madgiant.co.za
