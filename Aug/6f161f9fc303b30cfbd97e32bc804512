James Milner gave Liverpool a deserved lead with a penalty shortly before half time, but Spurs got a reward for sustained second-half pressure when Rose drilled home the equaliser.The England fullback's strike means he has already matched his tally from last season and it preserved Spurs' unbeaten record after their draw at Everton and victory over Crystal Palace.It was a frustrating outcome for visiting manager Jurgen Klopp on his return to the scene of his first game at the Liverpool helm last October, which ended in a 0-0 draw.His side showed a much sharper cutting edge than in last weekend's 2-0 defeat at Burnley, but their inability to close the game out enabled Mauricio Pochettino's Spurs to rescue a point.Both teams like to press high up the pitch and in the first half Tottenham had the greatest difficulty playing the ball out from the back.Deputising in goal for Spurs again in place of the injured Hugo Lloris, Michel Vorm was frequently called into action.The Dutchman produced a stunning fourth-minute stop to thwart Philippe Coutinho from Roberto Firmino's square pass and twice raced from his line to expertly tackle Sadio Mane.Coutinho overcame a stiff hamstring to start and continually found space inside the Spurs box, with a shot deflected over and another comfortably parried by Vorm.Aside from a Christian Eriksen free-kick that Simon Mignolet fisted away, Spurs posed little threat at the other end, though Vincent Janssen could have won a penalty after being blocked by Joel Matip.Mane, meanwhile, was fortunate to avoid a red card after clattering Rose two minutes after being booked for a late one on Dele Alli.Janssen had replaced Kyle Walker after the Spurs fullback succumbed to illness, in a reshuffle that saw Eric Dier move to right-back and Alli drop into central midfield.It left the hosts with an unfamiliar configuration on the right flank and Liverpool exploited their uncertainty when Firmino was clipped by Erik Lamela after darting in behind him.Milner, Liverpool's left-back again, confidently steered the penalty into the bottom-left corner.The team in red continued to enjoy the upper hand in the second half, with Matip heading over, Nathaniel Clyne working Vorm and Mane seeing a volley chalked off for offside.But as the intensity of the visitors' pressing began to fade, so Spurs started to assert themselves.Eriksen side-footed over from Dier's cut-back and Mignolet produced smart saves to thwart Lamela and Toby Alderweireld before Spurs drew level with 18 minutes to go.Released by Alderweireld, Dier cut inside onto his left foot and crossed, Lamela flicked on and Rose brought it down at the back post before skewering a shot past Mignolet.Liverpool procured one last sight of goal, but Georginio Wijnaldum's effort was fielded by Vorm.Reds bid big for teenLiverpool have submitted an 11-million bid for Borussia Dortmund's US teenager Christian Pulisic.But Klopp's former club are resisting all attempts by their former coach to lure one of the most exciting young talents in Europe to Anfield.Pulisic, a versatile winger who signed for the German club's academy during Klopp's reign, enjoyed an instant impact when promoted to the Dortmund first team last seasonKlopp is desperate to reunite with the youngster and continue his development on Merseyside but it is proving a difficult task convincing his former club to do business.Dortmund have no wish to sell the 17-year-old and it will take all Liverpool's power of persuasion to conclude a deal before the end of the transfer window. It seems Klopp is likely to be disappointed despite making an incredible offer that would comfortably make Pulisic the most expensive teenager in Liverpool history.
