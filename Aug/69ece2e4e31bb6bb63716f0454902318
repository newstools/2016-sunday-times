Since 2007 alone, we have been treated to a 6-3, 4-4, 5-1, 4-2, 3-3 and two 4-1s.It may be the first match of the season, but there is already enough of a backstory to go round at the Emirates.Arsene Wenger faces a defensive crisis, with Gabriel Paulista and Per Mertesacker injured and Laurent Koscielny unfit. Having identified that a central defender was an urgent priority, Wenger failed to sign one in time.The need for a striker is even more long term, Wenger first mentioning the desire to provide support for Olivier Giroud in May. Since then, Arsenal have been linked with about 24 different forwards.Not only have they not signed a striker, but Giroud is still not fit enough to start. That leaves Theo Walcott to lead the line, unless Wenger chooses to use Alexis Sanchez as a false nine.Wenger isn't the only manager under pressure.Jurgen Klopp insists that there are no more excuses for Liverpool, no more transitional seasons, no more "next year could be our year".The German believes he has his squad, and that means Liverpool must compete for a top-four place.To do that the Reds must compete away from home at their likely rivals for that honour, which means improving their record against Arsenal.In the last 15 years, their away record reads: Played 19; Won 1; Drew 8; Lost 10. Liverpool's return against the top seven teams last season was a slightly miserable 14 points from 14 matches.A loss at the Emirates to day, and Klopp and Wenger will already begin to feel the heat.
