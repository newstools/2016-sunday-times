Manchester United broke the world transfer record earlier this week with the 89-million acquisition of Paul Pogba from Juventus, taking their total spend for the summer past the 140-million mark.Manchester City have also joined their neighbours in spending big this summer, laying out close to 150-million on eight new recruits.Spurs, in comparison to the Manchester clubs, have been relatively quiet in the transfer market, signing just two players ahead of the 2016-17 season - midfielder Victor Wanyama and forward Vincent Janssen for a combined 28-million. But Pochettino is convinced the big spending from rival clubs is just a sign of their unhappiness of the standard of their current crop of players."That shows when you spend a lot of money it is because you are not happy with your squad or your players and you are desperate to improve your squad," said the 44-year-old."I am very happy with my players. I think it is very difficult to find better players than we have."Despite this, the Argentine admitted his openness to signing another two players before the close of the summer transfer window, but insisted any potential new recruits would need to improve the existing squad.He added: "We are open to adding one or two players or maybe no one. But if we have the possibility to sign a player that can improve us, we are very open."Meanwhile, Pochettino believes his players have learnt from the painful experiences of last season and are focused on making things right this time.His side were enjoying the club's best season since the early 1960s as they tussled with Leicester City for the Premier League title.But they choked in the final weeks and a bad-tempered draw at Chelsea handed the title to Leicester before a humiliating 5-1 defeat at already-relegated Newcastle United allowed bitter rivals Arsenal to pip them for second spot. That added up to a bitter close-season for Tottenham supporters, but Pochettino has been focused on making things right this time and the Argentine coach is confident his players are ready to put the past behind them."We will try to improve and learn from the past," he said."We need to improve a lot of things - to compete better, to behave better, to be more calm, to focus more on things that can improve the team."The players were told as such as soon as they returned from their pre-season tour of Australia."I needed a lot of meetings after Australia to talk about different things," Pochettino added."It's true we were all disappointed with the way we finished the Premier League. We need to show we are clever and learn from our mistakes."There's not a lot of change in the changing room and squad and I think that can help us."Pochettino has added Kenyan midfield player Wanyama, an 11-million capture from Southampton, and Netherlands forward Janssen, who cost 17-million from AZ Alkmaar, to his playing pool.
