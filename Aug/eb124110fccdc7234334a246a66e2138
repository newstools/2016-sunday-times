Proteas ace Hashim Amla does not seem to subscribe to this notion. While he has a long-proven ability to score runs anywhere in the world, his inability to click in Kingsmead tests sticks out like a sore thumb.With a decent ODI return of 319 runs from seven innings at an average of 45.57, his test average at Kingsmead dwindles to 19.38 in 18 innings with just 357 runs collected, with four fifties, since his home debut against England in the 2004 Boxing Day test.Amla the Highveld batsman is a different proposition: 17 knocks at the Wanderers have produced 732 runs at 43.05 while SuperSport Park in Centurion has rich pickings for him.The venue for today's second test has seen Amla effortlessly pick off 1,080 runs at an average of 80 in 13 innings with four hundreds and five 50s.It should not come as a surprise if the Peaceful Warrior makes up for his home failure during the test.Why the Kingsmead trouble? Not even former Proteas opener and convenor of selectors Andrew Hudson has the answer and he played all his first-class cricket for Natal and the Dolphins."I suppose you have to ask him in terms of what his thoughts are but maybe it could be because of the high expectation that comes with batting in Durban with the community or maybe he feels under pressure to score in Kingsmead."The way you approach the game and bat is the same as batting on any other surface," Hudson said."It wasn't that bad batting at Kingsmead even though I didn't get a test hundred but I batted there for my whole career. At one stage I think I was the highest first-class run scorer at Kingsmead but I also think I was stymied by the generally fewer tests I played at Kingsmead. I think I played only four or five matches there."While an interview request was politely declined, Amla is certainly not the only world-class batsman who was no great shakes at home.Rahul Dravid famously struggled at his M. Chinnaswamy Stadium base in Bangalore where 16 test innings netted him only 302 runs at 20.03 with two 50s.This is the same Dravid who is regarded as India's best ever batsman on the road. Double hundreds in Rawalpindi in 2004 (270) and Adelaide in 2003 (233) led to famous Indian victories.Brian Lara never quite got the groove on at the Queen's Park Oval (989 runs at 41) in Trinidad despite memorable hundreds in losing causes against Australia in 2003 (122) and South Africa two years later (196).Former Proteas allrounder and record wicket-taker Shaun Pollock said the game had a funny way of humbling the best even though he could not pinpoint why Amla struggles in Durban."I simply don't know why he struggles in Durban and I can't shed any light on that but he put together a reasonably decent innings in the first test before he was dismissed. He looked brilliant but the stats do tell a different story," Pollock said.
