Well, not quite.It is my exaggerated way of explaining the extent of how tight the son of Ga-Rankuwa and the club of Orlando have been.Tighter than a tongue and saliva kind of situation.That bread and butter kind of togetherness.The side by side inseparableness akin to ebony and ivory.He who wore jersey No14 on his back for his club and got 14 caps for his country, has called time on his career after, you guessed it, 14 years of sterling service to the game of billions.You don't have to go to google to learn that Lekgwathi has abundantly and exceedingly etched his name in the annals of the club's history.He remains the first and only Sea Robber skipper - or a captain of any club in the Republic for that matter - to lead his team to a double-treble.He hoisted high a half-a-dozen trophies in two seasons.2010-11: MTN8. League title. Nedbank Cup.2011-12: MTN8. Telkom Knockout. League title.As a result of scooping all that silverware, his biceps became so strong he was given strict instructions to stay away from the iron section of the gym.Before the trophy bounty, Lekgwathi had spent seven seasons without enjoying any cup glory.In Lekgwathi, Pirates had a perfect intersection of dedication, loyalty, leadership, work ethic and resilience.With him around, the Bucs rearguard never had a crisis - he was one of the few to play leftback, centreback and rightback with immaculate ease.This soldier and stalwart is a shining example to young South African soccer-star-wannabes of how to live their lives so that their careers too could enjoy such longevity.An absolutely consummate professional, Lekgwathi was the first to arrive and last to leave at training. We're talking about a man who for donkeys of years operated on a season- to-season contract.Sometimes he played not having crossed the t's or dotted the i's, yet he never threw his toys out of the cot.It is a crying shame that on Wednesday, when he bade farewell to the fans, someone who gave his life to the club waved at so many empty grey seats at Orlando Stadium.At least Tendai Ndoro's hat-trick gave Lekgwathi something to cheer about and the 3-1 victory over Lamontville Golden Arrows saw him bow out on a winning note.Through inspirational leadership, the former Mahwelereng Real Rovers and Ria Stars defender gave his life to Pirates and now it is the club's turn to give back.Pirates chairman Irvin Khoza should organise a testimonial match for Lekgwathi.Anything less would be a travesty of justice for a man who left everything on the pitch for Bucs and always seemed prepared to give an arm and a leg.Secondly, the services of such an influential figure should not be lost to Pirates.When it comes to making new players appreciate the institution that is Orlando Pirates Football Club, no individual is better qualified to conduct the induction than Lekgwathi.Who wouldn't want to learn the ropes by imbibing the pearls of wisdom dispatched by Lekgwathi, a veteran of more than 400 Premier Soccer League appearances?He was more than just a player.With the landscape littered with the corpses of those who came after him, but fell flat on their faces thanks to the pitfalls of fame and fortune, Lekgwathi revelled in his role as a big brother.He often took it upon himself to advise his colleagues to invest their money wisely.Whereas some changed slick German sedans like there was no tomorrow, Lekgwathi arrived at training behind the wheel of a panelvan.Captain fantastic. Skipper of the Sea Robbers ship. You steered them through stormy waters and calm seas.When the ship hit an iceberg, you never walked the plank. You never wavered. Lucky Lehlohonolo Lekgwathi, the best in the business. #14Twitter: @bbkunplugged99
