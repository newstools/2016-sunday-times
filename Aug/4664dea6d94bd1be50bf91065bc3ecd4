Disclaimer: I'm against anything that harms a child in any way and is justified because of vanity. The most common danger associated with piercing is infection, usually due to improper care. Babies younger than six months are at a higher risk because their immune systems are still strengthening. Another concern is pain. Medically, it's agreed that after the age of six months, piercing a baby's ears is safe.What is interesting to me is it seems that those who pierce their children's ears at a young age tend to be people of colour and those who judge are mainly white. Is this a matter of one culture deeming itself superior to another, or are children facing real dangers here?Think of Hollywood stars like Gisele B ndchen, Kim Kardashian and Camila Alves, who have been harshly judged for piercing their daughters' ears by US columnists and "white Twitter". I bet none of these little girls were taken into dark rooms and pierced with dirty needles, so that couldn't have been the concern. Pierced-ears bashers were arguing aesthetics: "It looks tacky."But in some countries, such as Spain, it is custom for newborn girls to have gold studs put in their ears soon after birth. And in many black South African homes, piercing young is commonplace. Isn't it odd that something like piercing your daughter's ears can be compared to genital mutilation while circumcising a little Jewish boy at birth is perfectly acceptable in the same eyes?I suspect we should all be more concerned with regulating how both practices are performed to make sure no harm is brought to a child in the name of beauty, tradition or religion.
