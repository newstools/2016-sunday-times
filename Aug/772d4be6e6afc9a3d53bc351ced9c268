There were also those like Kaizer Chiefs defender Eric Mathoho who came back with half a leg after suffering an injury during the 1-0 loss to Denmark on August 7 in Brasilia.Bafana Bafana assistant coach Owen da Gama had a front-row seat and it is no surprise that three members from that team have graduated into the senior side.Deolin Mekoa, Abbubaker Mobara and Maphosa Modiba made an impression on Bafana coach Ephraim "Shakes" Mashaba.Qualification for the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations in Gabon did not go to plan for the national side because of their disastrous start to their campaign.A goalless draw at home to Gambia and an inexplicable 3-1 away loss to Mauritania last year snuffed out their Afcon dream.With Mathoho's absence and rightback Anele Ngcongca being a doubtful starter, reshuffling the back-four will be a necessity.Da Gama did not say whether there will be wholesale changes for Friday's clash against Mauritania at Mbombela Stadium, but said the under-23s coming through was a by-product of improved junior age-group performance."It's important that we reward the under-23 and the under-20 players because we took an under-20 player with us in Tercious Malepe," Da Gama said."It's all about exposing these players to the highest level of football available and growing them in the meantime."We've got our pride at stake and we're playing for the country. We've got to show that the result we had against them earlier in the qualification phase was a mishap because of circumstances."It's a result we've got over and we won't cry about it even though the circumstances were very bad. We just need to show our determination and our resolve like we did against Gambia."Positive results on Friday and in the Nelson Mandela Challenge with Egypt at Orlando Stadium next week Tuesday have to be produced with meaningful performances. The onus is on the Bafana brains trust to concoct performances that will inspire confidence when the national team goes to Burkina Faso on October 3."It has to be a case of continuing where we left off against Gambia and making sure that we get some momentum moving into the World Cup qualifiers," Da Gama said."You can't start afresh ahead of something as big as the qualifiers. That would be detrimental and we have seen that in the past. We need to use each chance we have to build momentum and Friday will be the first step."If you look from where we started and where we are now, we have achieved a lot but we know the focus is on the World Cup and Vision 2022. It's all about getting the system right in the national structures and making sure there is continuity and a conveyor belt for players."
