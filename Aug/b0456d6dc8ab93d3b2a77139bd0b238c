A seasoned batting lineup that included Jacques Kallis, Graeme Smith, Alviro Petersen and AB de Villiers had them for a three-course meal. Tim Southee missed that series through injury and that may not have been such a bad thing.Brendon McCullum's Black Caps were clouted in Cape Town and Port Elizabeth in three and four days respectively.Three years on, Boult (41), Southee (50) and Wagner (21) have morphed into a bowling attack every bit as good as any other. FIERY,FAST ANDThey captured 23 of the 40 Zimbabwean wickets on unresponsive surfaces in Bulawayo during their recent 2-0 series win.With equally slow pitches expected in Durban and Centurion, it was the perfect warm-up.They acquitted themselves very well on recent tours to England and Australia where the dice was heavily loaded in the batsmen's favour.At home, they have been an irresistible force.Former New Zealand and Titans wicketkeeper Kruger van Wyk witnessed their growth."The New Zealand bowlers have a slight advantage of having overs in their legs and the wickets in Zimbabwe were difficult for pacemen. New Zealand's bowlers have been increasingly successful and, with their bowling attack, they believe they're a better side than the one that was here three years ago," Van Wyk said."Since that last tour, Boult and Southee have been entrusted with opportunities and they've made them work for them. They've taken them with both hands in all formats of the game."They are a more mature and skilful group and they're still a young bowling attack as Wagner is the only one who is 30."Wagner's persistent short-ball attack dovetails comfortably with Boult's swing and Southee's mastery of swing and seam. There's also a trend of teams struggling to deal with bounce and movement because of white-ball cricket These are facets South Africa's batsmen struggled with during the England test series where Stuart Broad's bounce and lateral movement overwhelmed the hosts.Van Wyk understands how well-equipped South Africa's batsmen are in terms of dealing with the short ball, but also knows New Zealand's unheralded yet efficient batting group will be tested."The South African top order will be tested with the short ball, but so will New Zealand's top order because of South Africa's quality bowling," Van Wyk said."They will dish out what they get. There's also a trend of teams struggling to deal with bounce and movement because of white-ball cricket."I think South Africa's batsmen are equipped to deal with the short ball very well ... a sustained attack often reaps the requisite rewards. It's all about being selective."
