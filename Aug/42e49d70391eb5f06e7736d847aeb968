His side would have still finished eight points behind Mamelodi Sundowns but the missed half-dozen would have added spice to what became a monotonous league race.But the chance for redemption comes sooner rather than later with the Amakhosi being their opening league opponents on Tuesday evening at the Bidvest Stadium.Hunt also has a mini-series of three tough games with Orlando Pirates and Mamelodi Sundowns after the Chiefs fixture. While he is keen to make up for last season's disappointments against Steve Komphela's side, he does not want his side to make the big games the focal point of their campaign. Wits collected the bulk of their points against the smaller teams."Each game will be tough and it doesn't matter who you play against. The first game is always tough for any team. We've got big home clashes against Pirates and Sundowns to follow the Chiefs game, so we know that each game is going to be difficult," Hunt said."We lost both matches to Kaizer Chiefs and I think we were the better team in both those games, but we were very unfortunate. However, that's how football works."We had a moment here and a moment there in both games and it was one of the few times where we played the better football but the scoreboard didn't reflect that. We showed that we're a dangerous side."However, we ended above Chiefs on the log and that was a feat within itself. At the end of the day, we must make sure we beat the lower teams and let the results against the big teams worry about themselves."Despite losing Sibusiso Vilakazi to Sundowns, Wits are expected to challenge for league honours, especially with Pitso Mosimane's side preoccupied with continental duties.Having finished third and second in respective campaigns, there is only one way left for them and that is up.Hunt knows the injury curse will make its presence felt in what will be a truncated season, but hopes his young players will come through for him again."I always believe in the youth and I always want to promote them when the chance arises. After all, I've always given youth a chance wherever I've worked.Last season we lost a number of key players to injury in an important part of the season and that scuppered our chances."
