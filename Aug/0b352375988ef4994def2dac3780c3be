It was the 36th over of the first day of the second test against New Zealand, and many in a burgeoning crowd that had been outnumbered by police earlier in the day rose to declare their support.Flags swirled with patriotic abandon as three renditions of Zimbabwe's national anthem were warbled into a clear blue sky from three different sections of the stands. If they continue with this statutory instrument of theirs, people are going to get hungrier and angrier The cricket continued, oblivious to the world beyond the boundary. What was happening in that world?Robert Mugabe has ruled Zimbabwe for 36 years, a time that started with hope and promise but has curdled into fear and loathing.By waving their flags and singing their anthem - as they had been asked to do by Evans Mawarire, the founder of the This Flag social movement - the spectators hoped to remind the world that Zimbabwe was in dire straits.But they were failed by television cameras that did not swivel to reveal the reality of what was happening in the crowd. Zimbabwe fans urged to take protest to home cricket Test against New ZealandThere was more reality beyond not just the boundary, but the walls of the ground, where a group representing Women of Zimbabwe Arise (Woza) tried to buy tickets using crudely counterfeited currency.The national symbol, the Zimbabwe bird, was on one side. On the other was printed: "A hungry nation is an angry nation" and "no to bond notes".The US dollar became the currency of choice in 2009 after Zimbabwe's dollar collapsed to hyperinflation.Zimbabwe has since been financially stable but plans to introduce US dollar-backed bond notes in October have sparked fears that an already crippled economy could implode.Several protesters were detained by police, some on horseback, others with dogs. But Woza founder Jenni Williams managed to wedge herself against admission gates that were hastily locked in protesters' faces."If they are refusing to allow me to pay with my bond note why are they bringing a bond note to Zimbabwe?" Williams told Sunday Times."If they continue with this statutory instrument of theirs, people are going to get hungrier and angrier. If they continue with bond note nonsense we are moving to doomsday."Minutes later Williams was roughly dumped into a police truck and carted away. Police denied she had been arrested: "She has been moved for blocking the pavement."
