POLOKWANE City reached the last eight of the Nedbank Cup yesterday.The home side came into this clash on the back of six straight wins without conceding in their own backyard.One of those victories came two months ago at the same Phokeng venue where Platinum Stars won 3-0 in a league match.This time, however, it was a different ball game with Rise and Shine digging deep for revenge.Dikwena looked on course for another win on their home turf early on. Star midfielder Robert Ng'ambi put his side 1-0 up in the 12th minute after his header was deflected into the net.Cavin Johnson's men almost doubled their lead in the 27th minute, but Ndumiso Mabena's header from an excellent cross by Vuyo Mere sailed over the bar.City's attacking men rarely troubled Stars' defence, but when they did the ball ended in the back of the net.On the stroke of half time, Edgar Manaka levelled with a header from a cross by Themba Mavundla. It was 1-1 at the break.The second half turned out to be as dull as the first and it took all of 20 minutes for a real shot on goal.Polokwane were awarded a free kick outside the box in the 65th minute after Isaac Nhlapho brought down Puleng Tlolane. Striker Sphesihle Nzimande almost scored from the resulting free kick, but he was unlucky as his shot hit the upright.Two minutes later, at the other end, Lebohang Motumi fouled Ng'ambi outside the box. Mabena's effort was not good enough as the ball hit the visitors' defence.Mabena, who was in the Bafana Bafana squad that played Cameroon this week, could have done better in the 72nd minute when he had another opportunity but again disappointed as his curling effort from close range went over the bar.Stars' young midfielder Kobamelo Kodisang came close to getting a second in the 74th minute, but his attempt came off the crossbar and City cleared.As the end of regulation time approached, Gift Sithole was given his marching orders after a second bookable offence and Stars were down to 10 men.The visitors took full advantage during extra time.In the 110th minute, Polokwane striker Tlolane took on Ryan de Jongh in the box and the latter mistimed his challenge to bring down Tlolane. The referee, with the help of his assistant, decided to give Rise and Shine a penalty.Defender Carlington Nyadombo took the responsibility and converted to get the all-important goal for his side.
