Sundowns were eyeing a treble this season, but Tendai Ndoro and Mpho Makola spoilt it all with goals in extra time to send the Buccaneers into the semifinals where they join SuperSport United and Free State Stars.The win gives Pirates a chance of finishing an inconsistent season with silverware, while Sundowns will now have to go all out to make sure they win the league title after they were booted out of two major knockout competitions in four days. On Wednesday, the Democratic Republic of Congo club AS Vita knocked the league leaders out of the Caf Champions League on away goals and last night, in front of a full house, Sundowns were put to the sword by a Pirates team that looked much fitter in extra time.Ndoro scored the opener for the visitors with a cool, left-footed finish in the second half of extra time, before Makola sealed it with the easiest of tap-ins from a Ndoro pass.Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane labelled Ndoro as the danger man and it was the Zimbabwean who did the damage, continuing his fine form in the Nedbank Cup.He has now scored five goals in three matches in the competition and could just be the man to bring back the glory to a Pirates team craving some success.The Buccaneers must be fancying their chances of winning the competition, having knocked out two giants in Sundowns and Kaizer Chiefs.This match, however, was not a classic. It had all the makings to be one, with two in-form teams, but Sundowns and Pirates were frankly just poor.From the first minute, it was clear Pirates wanted to stop Sundowns' main source of creativity, Khama Billiat. Bucs defender Edwin Gyimah twice went in hard on tackles on Billiat in the first five minutes and was booked for that. The Zimbabwean has been a nightmare for the opposition this term. That early warning meant Gyimah had to take it easy from then on and couldn't really get stuck into challenges whenever Billiat was in possession. The Ghanaian was a walking red card - and it was only a matter of time that he would get sent off .After a poor first half, the second period of regulation time was no better. Players gave the ball away far too easily and no one really tested the goalkeepers, except Billiat, who forced a good save out of Brighton Mhlongo early in the half.Pirates, to nobody's surprise, had to play the final 18 minutes of the match with 10 men after Gyimah's inevitable dismissal due to a second bookable tackle on Billiat.Sundowns had the one-man advantage, but they did not use that, and in the end they were punished by Ndoro and Makola in extra time.Mosimane walked off a disappointed man - and now has to focus on winning the league at all costs.Pirates won 2-0 after extra timeMamelodi Sundowns 0Orlando Pirates 0
