Deinster SV, a team from the German lower leagues, digitally altered a team photograph to make the whole squad appear black.The photo was posted on the team's Facebook page in response to the racially motivated attack on two of its black players over the Easter weekend.The coach of the North German club, Soenke Kreichich, claimed the two players, both Sudanese refugees, were the subject of physical and verbal abuse during Easter celebrations.The incident in question was recalled in the caption accompanying the doctored photo."Our friend and fellow player Emad was insulted and beaten on Saturday [last week] on racial grounds. Wenger banks on Wilshere for England"This is just sad!" the post read."Violence against refugees is pathetic!!"Emad and Amar - you belong to us. We are pleased that you are with us!!!"We wanted to make a stand among ourselves, but also to the public," said the Deinster coach."It should make it clear that Emad and Amar are an inherent part of our team, and not a minority on which you can use violence to let off your personal frustration."The post, which currently has 17000 likes on Facebook, has received a mixed response from people on social media.One user wrote: "Your statement is fantastic; it's the best story I've read today."While one reply inferred the gesture was inappropriate."How is this a protest against racism? Not sure about that one."UK retailer Tesco were forced to apologise last year after one of their workers came to work with a "blacked up" face.Mary Hotlz was ordered from the shop floor after customers complained her costume - in homage to the main character from the film Big Momma's House - was found to be offensive by Tesco customers.
