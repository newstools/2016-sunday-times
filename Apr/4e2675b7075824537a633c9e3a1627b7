Mourinho wants to start in his next job immediately after the end of the season to organise a transfer strategy before the window opens in July, says The Guardian. And that means United "have until the start of May" to make a formal approach.But that would mean telling Van Gaal that his time was up before the end of the season, potentially undermining United's push for a top-four finish and the FA Cup.So far United have refused to discuss the possibility of Mourinho taking over at Old Trafford."This is partly a show of support to the Dutchman by [Ed] Woodward and the Glazer family, who own United, but it also suggests the executive is undecided regarding Mourinho's candidacy," says the paper.It adds that Mourinho has been offered other jobs since leaving Chelsea.
