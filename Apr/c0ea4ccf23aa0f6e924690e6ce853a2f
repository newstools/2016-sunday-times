Banyana have been in camps since November, which Pauw requested to try to keep the players at a decent level in the absence of a top-flight women's league in South Africa.The coach attended the Olympic draw in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday, where she was also canvassing for potential warm-up opponents from teams not in South Africa's group who have also qualified for the women's tournament. "We have been setting up a few games here, and we will announce that hopefully soon," Pauw said."Great teams are interested, and that is the advantage of reaching the Olympics. People are curious and want to see us."Banyana's camp has broken up because of a lack of cash flow at the SA Football Association."We resume on April 23. By then, the players will have had individual programmes," Pauw said."We are looking for funds. There has been contact with the lottery and they have not allocated funds yet."Banyana qualified for the Olympics via an 8-2 aggregate victory over Gabon, 2-0 over Kenya and1-0 over African powerhouse Equatorial Guinea.Zimbabwe are Africa's second team at the 12-team tournament, where the top two group teams and two best third-placed sides reach the quarterfinals.
