Thobani Mncwango's twin brother, Mthobisi, and his mother both support Kaizer Chiefs, but on that day they did not care that Amakhosi were embarrassed by a third tier Baroka FC team in a match people still talk about."I remember that day," Mthobisi said, referring to the time Baroka beat Chiefs 2-1 in the Nedbank Cup quarterfinals at Peter Mokaba Stadium."I support Chiefs, but I was not angry when he scored [the winning goal]," added Mthobisi, who plays in the ABC Motsepe League. If you thought the Soweto derby was a torrid affair, spare a thought for the Limpopo clash between Polokwane City and Baroka FCFive years have flown by so quickly. Mncwango has gone from being a hero in arguably Baroka's finest day to becoming a contender for the golden boot in the PSL with Polokwane City this season.Currently on 11 league goals, Mncwango will have memories of the day his goal sunk Amakhosi when he faces his former club in Polokwane today in the same competition and, ironically, the same stage they knocked out the Soweto giants."I love Baroka. I am who I am today because of them," said Mncwango."I'll never forget the team we had. We had players who were hungry. I still have pictures. I miss them, but I'm a City player and I want to do well for my team. Moving up to the PSL has helped me because I was able to build my parents a house and I am able to support my child."Mncwango does not like seeing Baroka lose, but he thinks it would be best for his former club to get knocked out of the Nedbank Cup.Baroka have been put under tremendous pressure in the National First Division by Highlands Park for automatic promotion and Mncwango feels they need to let go of the cup competition and focus on trying to win promotion. Juggling both competitions may prove to be too much for them."I think it will be good for Baroka to lose, so that they can focus on winning promotion. My wish for them is to be in the PSL next season. They deserve it."
