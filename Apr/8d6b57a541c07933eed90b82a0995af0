Sakho has not been suspended over the potential violation, but Liverpool have decided to leave out the France international while the probe continues and he was absent from the squad for yesterday's league fixture against Newcastle United at Anfield.Reports in France claim Sakho tested positive for a fat burner after the Reds' 1-1 draw against Manchester United in the Europa League on March 17, but Liverpool have not confirmed those suggestions."Yesterday, Friday 22nd April 2016, a formal communication was received from Uefa stating that they are investigating a possible anti-doping rule violation by Mamadou Sakho," a statement on Liverpool's website read. Iheanacho at the double for City"The player will respond to Uefa on the matter. The player is currently not subject to any playing suspension."However, the club, in consultation with the player, has decided that while this process is followed the player will not be available for selection for matches."Sakho, who has 28 caps for France, is said to be ready to request his B sample be tested, with the deadline for that request set for Tuesday.The 26-year-old centre-back claims not to have known the composition of the weight-loss supplement and has told the club he acted in good faith.Sakho's Liverpool teammate Kolo Toure was suspended for six months after failing a drugs test while playing for Manchester City in February 2011.The Ivory Coast defender had tested positive for bendroflumethiazide, a weight-loss drug contained within "water tablets" and apparently recommended by his wife.If Sakho is unable to prove his innocence, it would be a significant blow to Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp as the former Paris Saint-Germain player has formed a solid partnership alongside Dejan Lovren in recent weeks. Martinez puts on bold face as Everton bossSakho, who moved to Anfield for 18-million in 2013, is in danger of missing the finale to Liverpool's Europa League challenge, with the team facing Villarreal in the semifinal first leg in Spain on Thursday. He could also miss the Euro 2016 finals in France if he were found guilty and given a long ban.Sakho started France's last match, a 4-2 friendly win against Russia at the end of March.Liverpool have made a swift response to the alleged doping violation and consulted fully with Uefa and the English Football Association.While Sakho is technically still available to play, it was felt by Klopp and Liverpool's US-based owners that the best course of action was to withdraw the player from selection and it is understood Sakho agreed with the decision.Liverpool won't face disciplinary action as that can only happen if two players in the same season are found to have had doping violations.France's RMC Sport was the first to break the news yesterday saying Sakho had been using a fat burner that, unbeknown to the player, contained a banned substance.Once this became known to the club, there was no choice but to suspend the player pending an investigation, which is likely to prevent Sakho from playing for Liverpool again this season regardless of the outcome.
