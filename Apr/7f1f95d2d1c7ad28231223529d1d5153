The under-23s, who have been drawn into Group A with Brazil, Denmark and Iraq, do not have a lot of time before the event starts in August and the coach wants tough opposition to have his side well prepared for the team's first Olympics since 2000."I think the best preparation is to play Sweden. They were the best team in Europe [last year]," said Da Gama. RIO ON THEIR MINDS"We are going to play Japan. They finished fourth in their competition in Asia. We have that game pencilled down, so now we are just waiting for confirmation from the association."We would love to also play against Mexico or maybe even Nigeria. We will sit down soon and discuss everything and plan the way forward."Da Gama is also hoping that some of his under-23 players will get an opportunity to play for the senior national team Bafana Bafana at the Cosafa Cup in Namibia in June."We hope some players can play in the Cosafa Cup. It will be a great opportunity for the players to gel. We have quality in the team. We just need to make sure we prepare properly," he said."Unfortunately we can't get players outside the Fifa window. But the [Premier Soccer] league closes in May and that will give us an opportunity to work with the players because we have the full backing of the PSL."
