What is a lipstick wardrobe - and how do you put one together?A clothing wardrobe consists of basics and standout items for special occasions. The same concept applies to a lipstick wardrobe. This should consist of a few shades that you feel comfortable wearing and that can transform your look. Start with the perfect nude. A classic red lipstick should be in your arsenal, too.Lira & Bobbi Brown chat beauty icons & diverse complexions How do you find the perfect hue of nude?Choose four shades and hold them up to your lips. This makes it easier to see which shades will work, which one is too light and what is too dark. A perfect nude should match your natural lip shade perfectly. That said, it shouldn't look like your foundation has been wiped across your lips; rather it should brighten up your lips.Do some women feel intimidated by using a bold lip shade?Yes. Just as makeup guru Bobbi Brown says, the shade you are wearing should make you feel comfortable and confident. If it doesn t, it s not the right choice.What is the correct way to apply a lipstick?Always start with a balm to moisturise and smooth the lips. Then after applying the lipstick shade with a brush use a lip liner to gently outline the lips. The reason for this is to help prevent the lipstick from fading and leaving behind that tell-tale liner line around the border of your lips. My lips get too shiny and lipstick doesn't stay put when I use a balm, how can I prevent this?Apply a balm during your skincare routine and wait for it to penetrate. Alternatively, use a single ply tissue to gently dab away excess shine. Another tip for matte lipstick, once applied, lay a single ply tissue over your lips and gently powder a translucent powder through the tissue. This will absorb shine and mattify your favourite shade.
