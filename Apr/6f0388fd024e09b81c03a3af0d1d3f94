Wilshere, 24, is nearing a return to first-team action having yet to make a competitive appearance for the Gunners this term after suffering a broken calf bone before the start of the season.England manager Hodgson has expressed his admiration and hinted the 28-times capped midfielder, who has a history of ankle injuries, could yet be in his squad even without much in the way of Premier League action.Asked if taking Wilshere would be a gamble, Wenger replied: "If he's completely fit, no. When you're a national team coach, you can take a gamble on one player but certainly not on five. He has to consider the whole situation. You can certainly take a chance on just one player."Meanwhile, Wenger said he had no qualms about Wilshere being included in the England squad, despite his injury record. Asked if he would welcome his inclusion and whether he expected Hodgson would select Wilshere, the French manager said: "Yes. Yes to both questions. Both answers are yes."Asked whether he would prefer to see Wilshere stay at home, the Gunners boss replied: "You want your players to compete."When you're a footballer you want to compete at the top level and what is important is that Jack, who is frustrated enough, regains confidence."
