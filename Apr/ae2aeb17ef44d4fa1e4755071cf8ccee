MAMELODI Sundowns survived more nervous moments than the scoreline suggested, but ultimately eased past Mbombela United in dominant enough fashion to earn a place in the Nedbank Cup quarterfinals.Sundowns appeared to be cruising to victory on the back of strikes by midfielder Keagan Dolly in the 25th minute and substitute striker Cuthbert Malajila in the 70th.Siyathemba Mnguni pulled one back for Mbombela in the 76th, who were then caught celebrating an offside goal to allow Themba Zwane to add a third for Downs in the 79th.Sundowns' Colombian striker Leonardo Castro flew in yesterday morning from leave at home for the birth of his baby, and was in the stands. Brazilians coach Pitso Mosimane opted for the mighty midget strike partnership of Khama Billiat and Dolly upfront.Ramahlwe Mphahlele returned from injury at rightback.Tiyani Mabunda made a rare start in front of big Soumahoro Bangaly in central midfield, Hlompo Kekana given a rest after his international exploits for Bafana Bafana against Cameroon on Tuesday.As much as the Brazilians are in free-flowing, goal-scoring form, a goal-fest is not always so easily achieved against plucky opposition from a league down enjoying their moment in the limelight.Mbombela are a neat, skilful team who certainly looked capable of giving even Sundowns a tough evening. The draw against the star-studded Brazilians seemed to only further motivate the team from Nelspruit.As against Highlands Park in the previous round, where Downs had to wait for extra time for Dolly's winner, the Brazilians had to work for their victory last night. Though there was also always the sense that Mosimane's men still had a gear or two higher they could have found if necessary.Frankly, had Sundowns been anywhere near their optimal rhythm - and perhaps the 10-day Fifa international break played a role in the men in yellow and blue making life harder for themselves - they could have cut Mbombela to ribbons, then tied them up in a neat package.In the opening 25 minutes, Mbombela's defence absorbed most of what Downs could throw at them. At the same time the visitors' quick, skilful little runners caused a nervous moment or two for the Pretoria giants' back four.Only Dolly's miscued volley into the Tshwane night sky threatened in front of goal for Sundowns in the first 24 minutes. But Downs' frontline's practised probing on the edge of Mbombela's area has split many a more vaunted defence this season.It took a moment's lapse to allow Dolly to play a one-two with Billiat to find space on the right of the area and slot low and easily past goalkeeper Thuto Xaba.Sundowns pushed to make the game safe early in the second half.In the 59th minute, Malajila - on for a booked Mabunda just after the break - fed Dolly down the left, who slipped his shot across goal wide. When a second did come it was stylishly executed.The underrated Zwane picked his way past at least one defender down the middle and sidefooted to Malajila, who was free on the right. He then finished low past Xaba.At 2-0 down, Mbombela found the confidence to run at the hosts. Mnguni's whipped-in cross was met by Inky Masuku's diving header onto the right upright.Fullback and captain Dingaan Maphase outstripped Sundowns' defence on the left, his chip was helped by Wayne Arendse's header into the path of Mnguni, who volleyed low past Kennedy Mweene to pull one back for Mbombela.Then the National First Division youngsters' inexperience showed. They believed they had equalised when Maphase had the ball in the net in the 78th, and were still celebrating after the match officials obscurely ruled for offside.Sundowns worked the ball to the other end to have four attackers on one defender. Billiat fed Zwane, who made it 3-1.
