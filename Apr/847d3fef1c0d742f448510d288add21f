The Dutchman seems to have more lives than a cat, but even among this bulging canon of lifelines he has been granted, the victory over West Ham United in a frenetic FA Cup quarterfinal replay felt particularly significant.If Van Gaal can somehow conjure a cup triumph - and only Everton now stand between United and a place in the final at Wembley on May 21 - it may well prove enough to save him at Old Trafford, regardless of whether the club miss out on Champions League qualification or the alternative managerial options.Klopp turns doubtersinto believersThere was further evidence at Upton Park that there is optimism and promise to be found down the line in the youthful figures of goalscorer Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial, Jesse Lingard and Tim Fosu-Mensah and, no doubt when he returns from injury, Luke Shaw, while fans will also hope other youngsters such as Memphis Depay, Andreas Pereira and Adnan Januzaj come good.But there are much more immediate concerns and, regardless of who is in charge from the summer, the importance of keeping David de Gea out of the clutches of Real Madrid or any other potential suitors will be one of the most pressing issues facing the manager.De Gea's progress over the past three and a half seasons has been little short of remarkable and in the second half at Upton Park, the Spain goalkeeper seemed to be on a one-man mission to drag United into the semifinals and, at the same time, keep the wolves from Van Gaal's door for a little longer.Many have Bayern Munich's Manuel Neuer down as the world's No1 goalkeeper but De Gea now lays the strongest of claims to that title. For United supporters and Van Gaal, in his most private moments at least, it really does not bear thinking about where the team would be without the Spaniard.Van Gaal embraced De Gea warmly at the final whistle on Wednesday, knowing full well that he had once again been bailed out by his keeper.Even if Van Gaal stays at United, the manager will be operating from a significantly weaker position if De Gea does not. Keeping the goalkeeper beyond the summer is crucial for the club.
