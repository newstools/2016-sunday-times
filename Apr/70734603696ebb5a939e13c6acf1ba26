West Bromwich Albion went ahead with their first attack after six minutes when Stephane Sessegnon fired a shot past a flat-footed Joe Hart in goal. Sessegnon then blotted his copybook when he fouled Aleksandar Kolarov and Aguero slotted home a 19th-minute penalty.Nasri, making his first league start since September, put City in front after 66 minutes, tapping in from close range after Aguero's effort was blocked.West Brom had chances to equalise against a shaky home rearguard, chiefly through Saido Berahino who missed with the defence expecting an offside flag.City, in fourth, are four points clear of fifth-placed Manchester United, who visit Tottenham Hotspur today. Hapless bottom club Aston Villa avoided relegation from the Premier League by the skin of their teeth yesterday despite a 2-1 loss at home to Bournemouth.Goals from Steve Cook and Josh King gave Bournemouth victory at Villa Park, but Norwich City's 1-0 defeat at Crystal Palace kept Villa hanging by a mathematical thread.Villa are now 15 points below fourth-bottom Norwich with only 15 points left to play for.Second-bottom Newcastle United appear increasingly doomed after a wretched 3-1 defeat at Southampton left Rafael Benitez's side six points from safety with six games to play.Sloppy defending allowed Shane Long, Graziano Pelle and Victor Wanyama to put Southampton 3-0 up before the hour, with Andros Townsend replying - spectacularly, but in vain - in the 65th minute.Swansea City effectively secured their safety by beating Chelsea 1-0 courtesy of a first-half volley from Gylfi Sigurdsson, ending interim Blues manager Guus Hiddink's 15-game unbeaten run.In the day's remaining fixture, Everton's James McCarthy and Watford's Jose Holebas both struck in first-half injury time in a 1-1 draw at Vicarage Road.
