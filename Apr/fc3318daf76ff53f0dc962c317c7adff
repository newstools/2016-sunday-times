Stars have been good at home winning the last six league matches in their backyard and keeping as many clean sheets. However they were horrible against Matsatsantsa playing with no desire to get a positive result out of the match.Cavin Johnson's men allowed United to bully them in the first 30 minutes a period the visitors took full advantage of.A defence that's usually solid was opened up easily by the visitors a quarter of an hour into the match as Thuso Phala and Dove Wome played a quick one-two from a corner before the latter's cross was met by a towering Mario Booysen to give United the lead.Without Jeremy Brockie who is away on family commitments United coach Stuart Baxter partnered Kington Nkhatha with Bradley Grobler upfront.The two combined for the visitors' second goal scored by Nkhatha just before the half hour mark.Grobler whipped in a delightful ball from the right flank and Nkhatha had all the time in the world to pick his spot and calmly direct the ball into the back of the net with his head.Frustrated by his side's horrible display Johnson took off holding midfielder Ryan de Jongh and brought on lanky striker Eleazar Rodgers in an attempt to put more pressure on the opposition defence.De Jongh signed in January from Maritzburg United was too casual in midfield and deserved to go off for someone who would make a difference.It's a pity that Rodgers did not have enough support upfront. He won a few balls in the air but none of his teammates tried to make a run to get on to any of his flick ons.The second half was a dull affair as both goalkeepers had little to do.United who still have the Nedbank Cup quarter finals to look forward to move up to seventh place while Stars stay in third spot.
