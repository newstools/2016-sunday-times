The Toffees, who have not won in seven Premier League matches, lost 4-0 at Liverpool on Wednesday night, a result Martinez described as horrific."I wouldn't be professional if I was wasting my time talking about what people think about the manager," he said, adding: "When you get bad results you will face scrutiny. We don't accept mediocrity and are not happy with our performances in the league."Spaniard Martinez has faced growing hostility from Everton fans in recent matches after a series of disappointing performances.Last Saturday's 1-1 draw with Southampton ensured this will be the club's worst season at home in their 138-year history. They have managed only 17 points at Goodison Park with eight defeats, five draws and four wins. Foxes fate remains in their own handsHe said: "Since the quarterfinal 'of the FA Cup' against Chelsea, the results have not been good enough and that's something we will look at next week."Asked whether there was a sense of dejection after the Merseyside derby on Wednesday, the 42-year-old said: "I wouldn't use the word dejection. We carry hurt."We need to forget about the league. We have put in strong work for 10 months and want to repair the hurt everyone at the club is feeling, from the fans to the players."Meanwhile, John Stones remains on the wanted lists of Europe's most respected managers, despite the criticism he is facing for his Everton performances, with Chelsea ready to make a fourth offer for the defender.Everton stand virtually no chance of keeping hold of Stones for a second successive summer after rejecting three bids last year, the highest of which was 37-million from Chelsea.Stones has come under fire during Everton's poor season and was again scrutinised after Wednesday night.But that has not put off Louis van Gaal, Pep Guardiola, Antonio Conte, Luis Enrique and Jose Mourinho, who would all jump at the chance to work with him.While critics have pointed the finger of blame at Stones for some of the goals Everton have conceded, the impressive list of managers who want to sign the 21-year-old shows they have faith that, with the right coaching, he will still prove to be one of Europe's best defenders.There is also a view that Stones is being judged harshly in comparison to other defenders, such as Chelsea's Gary Cahill, who have suffered just as many, if not more, problems.Other than Stones, Everton are fighting a losing battle to keep striker Romelu Lukaku, who is a target of Chelsea, Paris St Germain and Manchester United. Ross Barkley could also attract interest.
