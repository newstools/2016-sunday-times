Leicester, who won six of their next eight games to avoid what had seemed inevitable relegation, welcome the Hammers back to the King Power Stadium today needing three more victories to seal their first English top-flight title. Claudio Ranieri's team have only lost three times in 33 league matches this season and will move 10 points clear of their only serious remaining challengers Tottenham Hotspur with a sixth successive win.Spurs face Stoke City tomorrow.Leicester opened up a 10-point gap last week when they kept a fifth successive clean sheet to beat relegation-threatened Sunderland 2-0, but Spurs reduced the gap to seven points when they plundered three goals in six minutes to beat Manchester United 3-0 at White Hart Lane.Spurs almost certainly need to win to keep the title race alive and though his team are within touching distance of the finish, manager Ranieri is not looking forward to the run-in."The last five matches will be terrible because nothing is decided yet as far as the title is concerned," he said. "Tottenham are not giving up and we have to stay focused. Our mission is to do the best we can - if Tottenham overtake us we will compliment them. It is the law of sport." Leicester have 72 points from 33 games and Spurs 65 from 33, six points clear of Arsenal whose manager Arsene Wenger virtually conceded his team blew their chance last week after losing a two-goal lead in a 3-3 draw at West Ham.Leicester's Danny Drinkwater, meanwhile, has insisted there will be no change in the club's approach.The Midlands club were 5000/1 outsiders to be crowned champions of England before the season started."There isn't a secret to the dressing-room camaraderie, it's just that we're a bunch of lads that get along," said 26-year-old former Manchester United trainee Drinkwater.Three Leicester players - Jamie Vardy, Riyad Mahrez and N'Golo Kante - made up 50% of the six-strong shortlist announced this week for the Professional Footballers' Association Players' Player of the Year award.The trio are all set to be in action against a West Ham side who will be looking to revive their top-four ambitions following the disappointment of an FA Cup quarterfinal replay defeat by United at Upton Park on Wednesday.
