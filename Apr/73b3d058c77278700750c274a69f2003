Now that's interesting.Polokwane City chairman Johnny Mogaladi and Baroka FC head Khurishi Mphahlele say there is no bad blood between them, but you can be sure they will be enemies when their clubs meet in the Limpopo derby Nedbank Cup quarterfinal today."We can have coffee before the game, but when the game starts we're not friends. And then when it's over we can shake hands," said Mogaladi.The bragging rights are up for grabs and the two will probably go into the dressing rooms themselves if they have to, as a way to make players realise how important winning the match is.</img>Polokwane Cotu chairman Johnny Mogaladi is excited at the prospect of meeting archrival Baroka FC in the Nedbank Cup quarterfinal Image: SuppliedPolokwane Cotu chairman Johnny Mogaladi is excited at the prospect of meeting archrival Baroka FC in the Nedbank Cup quarterfinal Image: Supplied"Whoever loses will suffer because a lot of people [in Limpopo] will talk about it," said Mphahlele.He added: "Baroka is a brand. We have proved we are not here by luck. We will give them a run for their money and we will have more supporters at the stadium."We normally perform under pressure and when we are underdogs. But we are not underdogs, which is what I fear. We will see what happens, but no one will get bored."Mogaladi, however, is a bit cautious ahead of the derby."It's the first time we reach the quarterfinal. Baroka have been here before [in 2011]," he said."Our intention is to do well in the competition, but we should not forget that we have a mountain to climb in the Premier Soccer League (PSL)."We play Orlando Pirates on Wednesday and it's an important match. The good thing is that we will have a team from Polokwane in the [Nedbank Cup] semifinals."The one thing Mogaladi and Mphahlele agree on is that there should be a Limpopo derby in the PSL next season.Baroka are looking good to claim promotion to the PSL, while Rise and Shine - City - edged themselves closer to safety with a victory over Chippa United last weekend."This is something I have been waiting for, to have a [Limpopo] derby," said Mogaladi.His counterpart Mphahlele added: "I just wish we can get into the PSL next season so that we can have a Limpopo derby in the PSL."
