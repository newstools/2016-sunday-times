Whether South Africa's premier fast bowlers could be caught on the hop due to a relative lack of red-ball cricket remains to be seen as Twenty20 cricket dominates the global domestic landscape in between the accepted test periods.Most of them take part in the Indian Premier League, Caribbean Premier League and the NatWest blast in England. SA's lack of cricket a cause for concernThat leaves them with little time to get ready for long engagements, one being the two-test New Zealand series starting on August 19.That elevates the much maligned South African tweakers into importance, especially in terms of bowler management.First choice test spinner Dane Piedt has already put in the bowling mileage with two South African "A" team games against Zimbabwe and taking wickets in the process.He is also part of the squad that is taking part in a two-test series against Australia "A" that started yesterday in Brisbane.Warriors and South African test offspinner Simon Harmer has not had such luck, but seems to have an understanding of how much bowling Piedt and, in an extreme case, himself will have to do."With the drier outfields that will be expected because of the relatively dry winters, I do think that Dane will be used much earlier and will be expected to make more of an impact as New Zealand play a unique brand of attacking cricket.It was cultivated under Brendon McCullum and they have a new captain but that DNA remains. They will look to attack spinners," Harmer said."Durban has been a slow and turning wicket in my time as a franchise cricketer and I don't think that's going to change.</img>Simon Harmer expects New Zealand to attack.

Regardless of the fact that it's a winter surface, there will be turn."The excellence of the above off-spinners at test level has pushed leggie Imran Tahir towards the periphery, but Piedt and Harmer will come to the fore because of the expected slow conditions.Tahir said: "Regardless of the time of the year, spinners are a necessity in Durban because they always have a job to do.I do think the homework has been done in terms of how to deal with the Durban pitch and the different conditions, but winter cricket is not new in Durban."I also guess that test cricket at this time of the year is also new."At some point there will be help for spinners, but you also need to look at how good our spinners have become. I don't think the Durban surface will turn as much as it did during the South Africa-England test match but there will be turn."
