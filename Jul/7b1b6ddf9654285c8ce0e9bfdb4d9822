Quite frankly, the Sharks didn't seem to give a damn.With apologies to the 1939 Hollywood classic, the line spoken by Rhett Butler (Clark Gable), as his last words to Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh), in response to her tearful question: "Where shall I go?" seems to encapsulate what happened in atrocious conditions in Wellington, New Zealand, on Saturday. Buckets of rain, combined with that infamous "Welly wind" saw the Durban-based side simply blown out of the Super Rugby quarterfinal by a Hurricanes side which ran in six tries and reach the Super Rugby semis for the second straight year.For the first time in the history of the Southern Hemisphere championship, a side has been kept scoreless in a play-off match.It is a record Sharks captain Tendai Mtawarira did not want to be part of, describing the performance as an "embarrassing effort" against the top-ranked New Zealanders.With a howling wind and rain playing havoc with ball control, the Hurricanes still managed to cross the line six times as they raced away in the second half after leading 13-0 at half time.However, their celebrations were tempered with captain Dane Coles taken from the field in the second half and rushed to hospital with what appeared to be a serious rib injury.Trying times for Oz side BrumbiesIn the foul weather, the Canes cashed in on a turnover ball in the first half before TJ Perenara and Beauden Barrett defied the wind and rain in the second spell to orchestrate an attacking game."We knew we couldn't be too expansive because of the weather, but we wanted to play in the right areas of the field," said co-captain Perenara."We changed a few things with the weather. When we got the opportunity to get into a bit of space, we took it."While the Hurricanes move on to the semifinals, the tournament ended for the Sharks with Mtawarira saying things didn't go according to plan. "We wanted to play a territory game but the Hurricanes outclassed us," he said."We made a lot of costly errors, a lot of defensive errors ... and in the end it was an embarrassing effort."Barrett landed one penalty and after failing to convert the first-half tries by Loni Uhila and James Marshall, he was on target to land the extras when Jason Woodward, Vaea Fifita and Perenara scored in the second half.After he was replaced along with Perenara and Victor Vito with 20 minutes remaining, Woodward took over the kicking duties to convert Brad Shields' try at the end.Sharks flyhalf Garth April had three penalty attempts in the first spell and fell victim to the unpredictable wind each time.Prop Uhila thundered over for the first try from close range after JP Pietersen failed to gather a high kick that swirled around in the wind.Marshall scored the second from a blindside move after the Canes were gifted a scrum when a lineout delivery slithered through the hands of Sharks scrumhalf Michael Claasens.Perenara was instrumental in the first two tries of the second half as he waltzed through tackles to send Woodward and then lock Fifita over.He was then the recipient of a simple try when Uhila took a tap penalty close to the line and the big prop produced a sidestep that a back would be proud of to open up a gap for Perenara to dive through.Hurricanes (13) 41Sharks (0) 0SCORERSHurricanes 41 - Tries: Loni Uhila, James Marshall, Jason Woodward, Vaea Fifita, TJ Perenara, Brad Shields.

High and mighty On Friday, the Highlanders' 15-9 win over the Brumbies in their quarterfinal in Canberra continued a dominant season for New Zealand teams over their Australian opposition, winning 22 of their 26 encounters.It was a despondent Brumbies camp, bowing out of the finals race and saying goodbye to three of their star Wallabies, skipper Stephen Moore, flyhalf Matt Toomua and flanker David Pocock, who will all be heading elsewhere next season."It's difficult not to comment on some of those refereeing decisions," Brumbies coach Stephen Larkham said. "For me, Lausii [Taliauli] scored a try near the end and we had a dominant scrum all night and the ball has come out sideways in the final minutes and I cannot see how there is no penalty for that."It's really devastating because it is tough conditions tonight [on Friday] and we were behind on the scoreboard, but we found a way back into the game and we did everything right to win."
