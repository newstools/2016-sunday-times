New Zealand are busy with a two-match series against Zimbabwe before their South African assignment in the middle of the month.South Africa's relative lack of long-form cricket this year should be concerning. Their last outing was the 281-run caning of England at SuperSport Park in January.Batting coach Neil McKenzie is not overly concerned about the lack of long-form cricket leading into a test series. But inadequate preparation often results in poor performances.The last time a South African team went into a test without significant cricket was against Australia in early 2014. Fringe squad members and excelling first-class players came together for a two-day practice at the Wanderers ahead of the first test. It was the best of times, it was the worst of timesThe 281-run pummelling in the subsequent test at SuperSport Park showed an undercooked side."The guys have played a lot of cricket so I think it's up to management and you'd obviously want some game time but there isn't any available," McKenzie said."That's just the schedule and we have to make do with what it allows."We'll try to get a couple of middle nets going and we'll try to make the training camp as intense as possible and put guys through their paces."There will be a period to have the training camp and we know it's not the same as having first-class cricket and it is a challenge. The guys have played cricket though, so it's just a mental switch that's needed so we can focus on the long-form skills."While the key stars have opted to rest, fringe players like batsmen Temba Bavuma and Stephen Cook are in Australia with South Africa "A" to polish their games ahead of the New Zealand series.Cook rattled off a century in the second four-day game against Zimbabwe "A" two weeks ago alongside a first-innings 78 in the first "test".The importance of these preparations and the runs made by Cook is not lost on McKenzie."Those are the second-best guys in the country and that's where the guys are getting selected on their performances during the season," McKenzie said."While Heino Kuhn is doing well, there are a few test incumbents like Cook and Dean Elgar who will be opening there while Temba is also there. I think it'll make up for those guys as they didn't play T20 cricket."It's important for our openers to get some time under the belt."
