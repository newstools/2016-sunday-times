While the Cheetahs win he dearly needed wasn't delivered, the Central franchise again put the Sharks through the physical and emotional thresher in what was a tight but uninspiring clash last night.The end result looked convincing as the hosts made better use of their chances, but they were never comfortable against a team that always saves the best for them.The Sharks know the Cheetahs have been an inconvenient banana peel, having lost to them three times in the past three seasons. For a large part of the evening, they played like they knew the visitors have their number. Bulls get the job done and keep hopes aliveTheir inability to find any sort of structure and groove in the first half betrayed their nerves as the quarterfinal race enters the last lap.With Garth April's tactically sound showing delivering 16 points through two conversions and four penalties, injured pivot and regular captain Pat Lambie can afford to take another week's break with bigger challenges set to come.Such was April's composure, he effectively dealt with Francois Venter's never-ending attention as the Cheetahs captain looked for his channel with the accuracy of a heat-seeking missile.While the Sharks never looked like getting the bonus point, they are two points (39) ahead of the Bulls (37) with the Sunwolves to come on Friday while the Bulls travel to Bloemfontein to face the Cheetahs a day later.While rugby has thrown up surprises, the Sharks have one foot in the door in terms of a potential trip to Ellis Park on the weekend of July 22/23 to face the Lions in the last eight.What should have been a dry weather encounter was turned on its head by an unexpected sweeping shower before kickoff.It greased up the surface sufficiently to reward the team that played the percentages best. For a side with a game heavily based on passive-aggressive defence, the Sharks went out of character with a running game that could have worked if they had the right personnel to execute it.An attempt at a balanced and flowing game with the hulking and cement-handed Andre Esterhuizen at inside centre is like trying to pickpocket a thief. The Sharks should have added a third two minutes later when their defence created a turnover Instead, they were as quixotic as the stadium lights that took a hiatus an hour before kickoff at the conclusion of the Under-19 Currie Cup clash between the Sharks and Western Province.Fortunately they behaved for the rest of the game, and, like the home team, did not provide any warmth on what was an unusually chilly Durban night.The Cheetahs seemed more at home, but, with the territorial dominance enjoyed by the Sharks, their 15th-minute try through Raymond Rhule came as a surprise.They were aided by Tendai "Beast" Mtawarira's needless yellow card for raising his hand unnecessarily.Franco Smith's side played with a verve the Sharks could only dream of, but the Sharks desperately held out while their scrum disintegrated in Mtawarira's absence. To be or not to be in the thick of things is the Lions' Bok questionPerhaps mindful of the past embarrassments handed to them by the Cheetahs in the past three seasons, the Sharks stepped up later in the first half and the well-worked 35th-minute try by JP Pietersen was a result of applying attacking basics against a struggling defence.When the Sharks decided to go back to what works for them, their defence created opportunities, one of which was converted by substitute Stefan Ungerer in the 63rd minute. He picked up a loose pass from Fred Zeilinga and trotted to the line without much fuss.The Sharks should have added a third two minutes later when their defence created a turnover. With a two-man overlap, Pietersen's instincts as a wing kicked in when he kicked infield instead of freeing the two men on his outside.When April slotted a late penalty, the Sharks finally tried to express themselves, but having come so far in the tournament, it's best they stick with what has got them this far.Sharks: - Tries: JP Pietersen, Stefan Ungerer. Conversions: Garth April (2). Penalties: April (4)Cheetahs: - Tries: Raymond Rhule. Conversions: Fred Zeilinga. Penalties: Zeilinga
