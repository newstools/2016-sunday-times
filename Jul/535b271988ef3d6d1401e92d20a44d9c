While the two have coexisted and starred together in the Spanish capital, the 26-year-old Bale is often looked upon as Ronaldo's eventual replacement, and even as the star attraction at the Bernabeu, whenever he moves on.He's provided with the chance at the Euros to not only show that he can be Ronaldo's equal, but he can do him one better and lift his country to the cusp of a trophy that Ronaldo has never lifted. He's already outshone Ronaldo in the competition on an individual level when it comes to impact over the course of all five games.Bale's two free-kick goals (Ronaldo, meanwhile, has failed to score on 41 consecutive free kicks in major competitions), three in total and a cross that forced the decisive own goal in the quarterfinals are contrasted by Ronaldo's misfires against Iceland and Austria, his heroic two-goal showing against Hungary, his role in the winner against Croatia and his penalty conversion against Poland.But we must revisit Friday night's unbelievable performance where Bale - the world's most expensive footballer - had to win his duel with another megastar - Eden Hazard.This was a blazing, enthralling game between a side whose strength of character was beyond question and another who have been long on promise and short on delivery.After a torrid first 20 minutes in which Belgium threatened to sweep Wales back to Brexiting Britain, Bale led the fightback and fear gripped every Belgian soul. Were they England in disguise?Rarely will you see a clearer division between big-name talent (or potential, in Belgium's case) and cleverly cultivated team spirit. Which is not to say Wales were all dragons and defiance. They played some marvellous football after the early Belgian onslaught, snatching back possession and shaping their attacks smartly.Bale unleashed a nice blend of threats, drifting across the pitch in a playmaking role but also hurting Belgium with sudden direct bursts that unsettled a revamped back-four and forced Thibaut Courtois, in the Belgian goal, onto full alert. The national megastar has stepped up to become the voice as well as the talisman of the country s most successful team since 1958 Individual talent, team character: this was a night to observe the power of each.And a salient point about Bale's contribution to the drama is that he has fewer top-class teammates to conspire with. For Hazard, on the other hand, accomplices were everywhere: Manchester City's Kevin De Bruyne, Romelu Lukaku of Everton and Radja Nainggolan, whose shot past Wayne Hennessy on 12 minutes might have been fired from a crossbow.Bale has been a man transformed at this tournament. Gone is the shy, platitudinous distraction-phobic megastar we know at Real Madrid.With a little prompting from Chris Coleman and the Wales coaching staff, the national megastar has stepped up to become the voice as well as the talisman of the country's most successful team since 1958."The dragon on my shirt, that's all I need," Bale announced on the eve of the game - then repeated it with a tweeted picture of himself banging his fist on the Wales crest, with jawline raised.</img>Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo attends the training.

With a now familiar glint in his eye, Bale also urged the Welsh public "to enjoy the experience as a nation" and called on fans in Lille to match the Belgians decibel for decibel.There is no harm in boiling a game between nations into a battle between the two best players.Heaven knows this fitful tournament needs subplots.Then there's the matter of body language and overall leadership.Ronaldo has run the gamut of on-field emotions, and while he's ultimately stepped up when called upon in times of need to fulfill the duties of the captain's armband, it doesn't seem as if his emotions are nearly as infectious and influential as those of Bale, who's become the symbol of Wales's underdog success, and not just because of his play on the field.Both of these teams are about way more than just their centrepiece attractions, but they command the spotlight, and they'll have the opportunity to relish in it come Wednesday.Either way, one team will be one step away from its first major international trophy.Wales hasn't had a sniff of this stage on the international level, failing to qualify for every World Cup since 1958 and every European Championship, period.story_article_right2Its 1958 run to the quarterfinals was ended by a 17-year-old Pele, and since then it's been a black hole of misery until reaching its first major semifinal ever.Portugal, meanwhile, has had far more success on the World Cup and Euro stages (they've reached at least the quarterfinals in six straight Euro tournaments), but still haven't managed to finish the job.In fact, Portugal are nearly 12 years to the day from falling at home in the Euro 2004 final to surprise champion Greece. For a nation that has always seemed to boast a transcendent talent, whether it be Eusebio, Luis Figo or Ronaldo, it has constantly underachieved on the international stage.Even the run to these semifinals is not without caveats. Portugal haven't beaten anyone within 90 minutes (to be fair, they have not lost either), they needed a come-from-behind effort and penalty kicks to oust Poland in the quarterfinals and finished third in their group - behind Hungary and Iceland.Without the competition expansion to 24 teams, Portugal wouldn't be in this position at all. That said, tournaments are all about surviving, advancing and seizing opportunities. Another one is there for the taking for Ronaldo and his teammates.
