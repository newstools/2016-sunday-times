Because, you know, Theresa May is a woman. And, well, talking about a woman's sartorial choices undermines the woman's significance in the world. It objectifies her, okay?Apparently, we do not do this to men. Except the Donald. With the Donald I find that all sorts of sartorial and personal grooming choices are fair game. I have been exposed to more column inches about the coiffure and the badly retro-fitted '80s suits than my frontal lobe can bear without imploding or breaking out into a Rick Roll. Oh wait, that's what happened to Melania Trump and then she started channelling Michelle Obama at a presidential nomination s ance. See what happens?Still, Michelle is exactly the person I would choose to channel, given half the chance, so big ups Melania (also for the Rocksanda Ilincic dress - one of Michelle's go-to designers and albeit pure, demure and virginal white, not at all Bride of Frankenstein - which, given the circumstances, was probably a real concern).But the shoes, the Theresa May shoes - there is strategy in them shoes. I mean, here is a Prime Minister who is not scared to sport leopard print on her extremities. It shows a certain wild insouciance, a crazy single-minded disregard for the neat, conservative black court-shoe brigade. Here is a person who cleans up. Then she throws in the wild card - a Boris Johnson playing to her tune kind of wild card. She is a stealth bomber with an edge.Nobody saw this cool cat coming. The very people who would argue that to be taken seriously in this world you should dress "appropriately", perhaps in a comfortable sandal with a sock, should take a good look at that leopard-print shoe. Because you know - meeow.
