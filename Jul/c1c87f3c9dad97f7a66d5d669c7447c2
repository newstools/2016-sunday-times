This summer's second, and stronger, touring side are spending 10 days at the Ageas Bowl on the outskirts of Southampton.The Pakistan Cricket Board has shelled out more than 70,000 to prepare their team for this tour, such is its importance after the diplomatic disaster of 2010, with the spot-fixing centred on Mohammad Amir in the Lord's test.Arthur coached South Africa from 2005 to 2010 as they grew into a great test side, then Australia with less success which culminated in "homework-gate" just before the 2013 Ashes in England, from which he has lived and learned. And SA's next coach is ... Finding SA'S next cricket coach promises to be a challengeHe has coached Twenty20 franchises in Jamaica and Bangladesh, and in the first Pakistan Super League staged in the United Arab Emirates earlier this year, but it was still a culture shock when he arrived in Lahore to prepare for this tour.Staying in Suite One in the national academy at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore, Arthur has been like an ambassador sent from England to Constantinople in the Middle Ages, dazzled by the treasures of the Sublime Porte. He heard players diving into the swimming pool at 3am.Australian cricketers have been known to do that after a long tour and a few beers, but not every night.He met the best wrist spinner on the planet, Yasir Shah, when he wandered into the training camp so unconcerned about the schedule that Shah said: "I'm only two days late."The young wizard proceeded to bowl variations which Arthur had never seen in his 48 years."Having coached in South Africa, you don't really work with wrist spinners - you work with serviceable finger-spinners," Arthur said."I was absolutely absorbed watching him [Shah] bowl, the control he had and the amount of deliveries he had, it was amazing."At his disposal Arthur also has three left-arm pace bowlers, including Amir "who is swinging it beautifully and he has some serious pace now", and Wahab Riaz, as fast as anyone when in the mood and a master of reverse swing.The test sides of England and Sri Lanka do not have one fast left-armer between them. CSA or CIA? Spy games at Cricket South AfricaOn his TV he watched live cricket matches in Karachi that began at 11.30pm. Not only that: Mohammad Irfan, the tallest bowler in the game and Pakistan's opening bowler in one-dayers, was playing - and had just trained with the Pakistan squad.This was the Ramadan League.So Arthur's new job is not only to be the consultant to his captain Misbah ul-Haq but also to introduce what has been installed as best practice in other test-playing countries, like monitoring the players' fitness, skill levels and workload.Another eye-opener has been the self-discipline of Misbah and the senior batsman Younis Khan during Ramadan. They both left Lahore at dawn and did not eat or drink until sunset in Southampton which came, with a five-hour time difference, about 20 hours later.Arthur has appointed Steve Rixon, former Australia wicketkeeper, to work on what has always been Pakistan's weakest facet - fielding. He has also appointed England's former spin-bowling coach Mushtaq Ahmed to be test bowling coach and his translator.As one simplification at least, Ramadan will have ended by Pakistan's second warm-up game against Sussex, their last match before they return to Lord's.
