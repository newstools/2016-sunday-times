The supporters' intimidating chant, believed by many to be a Viking war cry, has reverberated around France's stadiums.It begins with a slow handclap and an accompanying shout of "HUH" before gathering pace to fill the air and silence opposition fans.With almost 10,000 supporters in France, the battle cry's impact has been described as "seismic" and likened to the haka performed by the New Zealand rugby team."Like the oars of a Gokstad ship building up to a battle-like momentum - when the synchronised clap and 'Huh' rise to a spine-tingling crescendo - Iceland are inspired and the opposition frozen," says the Irish Times."Many observers assume the chant has its origins in Iceland's warrior past, adds the paper, but it is in fact a celebration with Scottish roots," says the paper.The chant was picked up from Motherwell supporters in the Scottish Premiership just a couple of years ago. "Fans of Stjarnan - in Iceland - fell in love with the chant during a trip to Motherwell in 2014."
