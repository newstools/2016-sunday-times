The Joburg art scene is about to attract some serious new energy, with a dynamic new space in Rosebank's Keyes Art Mile precinct. Art dealers Justin Rhodes and Ashleigh McLean of WHATIFTHEWORLD and design gallerists Trevyn and Julian McGowan of Southern Guild will be opening a 300m contemporary exhibition space in August.Both galleries are strongly focused on representing artists and designers from around Africa, and this collaboration is sure to bring a year-round showcase of the best art and design from the continent to the city. "We're prepared to be non-conformist," says Rhodes, "and in forging this new partnership, we're creating an original forum and delivering a one-of-a-kind gallery experience."The first show opens in August and will present work by Nigerian photographer Lakin Ogunbanwo, Zimbabwean sculptor Moffat Takadiwa and visual artist Athi-Patra Ruga. There will also be furniture by leading designers such as Cheick Diallo, Hamed Ouattara and the late Babacar Niang as well as South Africans Gregor Jenkin, Porky Hefer and Dokter and Misses.
