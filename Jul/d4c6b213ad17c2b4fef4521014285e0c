The winning spot kick came from Jonas Hector after the game finished 1-1 following extra time.They will now face the winners of the other quarterfinal between hosts France and Iceland, who play each other today.Germany midfielder Mesut Ozil, who had experienced a quiet tournament so far, was in the right place to open the scoring in the 65th minute when he turned in Jonas Hector's cutback after good work from Mario Gomez down the left.The Italians, however, levelled with a 78th-minute penalty from Leonardo Bonucci after Jerome Boateng handled the ball.Germany, who had not conceded a goal in their previous four tournament matches here, took their time to get going against a well-oiled defence with Thomas Mueller having their best chance before Ozil broke the deadlock after more than an hour.Bonucci gave Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer no chance 13 minutes later with a well-placed penalty as Italy, who eliminated holders Spain in the last 16, refused to buckle and sent the game into extra time.Germany 1Italy 1Score after extra time 1-1 Score after penalties 6-5
