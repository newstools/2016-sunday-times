The forensic audit was conducted in May over a period of two weeks in which all 12 of the board members were tested individually.They all had to hand in their laptops and mobile devices apart from undergoing the lie-detector tests.The results of the polygraph tests have not yet been released, but the outcome of the spy games could be the focal point of the next board meeting on July 25. And SA's next coach is ... Finding SA'S next cricket coach promises to be a challengeIn an e-mail sent in January this year the board was unaware of the disciplinary action taken against Phangiso in the aftermath of his disorderly conduct on a flight back from India last year.They were only notified when the story was going to be published on January 17, with quotes from a number of board members expressing their displeasure at not being kept up to speed with the incident.A board member who spoke on condition of anonymity said although they did not object to the audit, they felt that their trust was being undermined."I do understand they came to us individuals and every member was obliged to submit to the audit but I wasn't happy with the fact I had to be audited."However, I submitted myself to the process but most of the other board members were not happy. Their response was negative," the board member said.Another board member said the audit was a matter of business being handled in a professional manner to ensure that members execute their duties correctly without fear or favour."It was part of a process that we all agreed on and it's part of the business. When it comes to these matters, when you're a professional and a director, you're expected to do your business in a professional manner. You have responsibilities as a director which you need to honour and adhere to. When you deal with business of any organisation, you have to act the part," the board member said.Another board member said they were barred from communicating with the media and all the communication has to go through chief executive Haroon Lorgat. Lorgat and CSA president Chris Nenzani are out of the country on ICC business. Mickey enters ring of fire to conquerCSA spokesman Altaaf Kazi, who was coy about the details of the firm that oversaw the audit, said the board and Lorgat were concerned with the leaking of information and steps had to be taken to prevent a repeat in future."You will fully understand why the board and CEO are extremely concerned with the leak of any confidential information and they have taken all necessary steps to prevent this in future. The reputation and integrity of CSA is fundamental to all of us," Kazi said.Attorney Themba Langa said CSA was well within its rights to commission an audit if it felt board members were indulging in malfeasant practice. However, he said, audits often have a way of backfiring if they are used to target individuals."If the said information that was leaked to the media is known only by the board, only they can make a decision on whether to commission an audit," Langa said."There needs to be a basis of knowing whether the leak came from the board, but those who have been subjected to lie-detector tests have to be given an opportunity to consult with their lawyers on the contents of the lie-detector tests because in those tests they ask you questions that make you nervous."Often, where there's a lie-detector test, everyone who took part in those tests, including those who are testing, have to undergo that test because you have cases when law firms leak stuff to the media," Langa said."If someone has reasonable evidence ... to undertake a lie-detector test, then it's fine but there must be an allegation of wrongdoing."sports@timesmedia.co.za
