The 42-year-old Welshman - who made a record 963 appearances and was an integral part of the side built by Alex Ferguson - is keen to pursue a managerial career, having been assistant manager during the failed spells of David Moyes and Louis van Gaal."It has not been a decision that I have made lightly. I'll take away so many special memories as well as a lifetime of experiences that will, I hope, serve me well in the future," said Giggs in a statement. "However, the time feels right and although I have no immediate plans to step into management, it is where I want to be."Giggs, who won 13 league titles and two Champions League trophies among other honours, said that it was an enormous wrench for him.Mourinho is keen to have his own backroom staff along with him which means Rui Faria replacing Giggs.Giggs was offered a different role but declined it.
