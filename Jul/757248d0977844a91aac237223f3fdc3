But the Foxes' Italian boss Claudio Ranieri is keeping his players' feet on the ground, insisting the goal for 2016-17 remains the same as 12 months earlier - avoiding relegation."It's the same this season at the start - to achieve 40 points, at the beginning, to be solid and to believe in yourself," the 64-year-old Italian said.Leicester, 5,000/1 outsiders in pre-season, were crowned champions for the first time in their 132-year history in May, handing Ranieri his first domestic title as a manager.They lock horns with Manchester United in the Community Shield at Wembley next Sunday.Ranieri has been busy in the transfer market, beating the club record outlay twice in a week to secure French midfielder Nampalys Mendy for 13-million and Nigerian forward Ahmed Musa for 16.6-million.One of his biggest tasks will be keeping his team of newly minted all-stars together, with big-spending Premier League rivals dangling lucrative contracts.Welsh international midfielder Andy King - the only player in the Premier League era to have won titles in the top three tiers - gave the manager a boost by signing a four-year deal on Friday.The 27-year-old, who made his Leicester debut in 2007, joins 19-year-old Ben Chilwell in committing along with Jamie Vardy.Ranieri told reporters King was "a good example for everybody", and described Chilwell as "one of the best young players in the UK". But the team's all-action defensive midfielder N'Golo Kante went earlier this month on a five-year deal to Chelsea for a reported 32-million.Kante's teammate, Algerian international Riyad Mahrez, has also been at the centre of summer transfer speculation alongside Kasper Schmeichel and Danny Drinkwater.Ranieri said, however, he expects all three to still be at the club when the transfer window closes.
