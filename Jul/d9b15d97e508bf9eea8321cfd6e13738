Saying Sibusiso Vilakazi is the most wanted man in South African football is stating the obvious.What is not, is which side will win the race to secure the signature of the skilful forward blessed with a beautiful football brain and, more importantly, a nose for goal.In a nip-and-tuck race behind the scenes, concerted efforts continue from both Kaizer Chiefs and Mamelodi Sundowns to make Vila their marquee signing.His club Bidvest Wits remains resolute in resisting the release of their prized jewel.For the duration of the off-season, Wits have remained true to their position: put dollops of moolah plus players of our preference on the table, or go bungee jumping without a rope. Your choice!The message to Chiefs: give us money, Bernard Parker, 30, and George Lebese, 27, and voila, Vilakazi is yours. It's all a question of doing the maths for DownsThe Students' missive to Sundowns: allow Anthony Laffor, 31, Cuthbert Malajila, 30, and Mogakolodi Ngele, 25, to come our way and you get your man. The ball is in your court!If Wits were to set the 26-year-old Vilakazi free, the Bafana international will be caught in a crossroads of sorts - which direction will he choose between Kaizer Motaung's Naturena Village and the Chloorkop of Patrice Motsepe?Let's start at the south of Joburg.Frankly, the eight signings Chiefs unveiled a fortnight ago were devoid of the fear factor."Bobby Motaung is well aware that the fans were not entirely excited by the eight new players the club has brought in."He is doing everything, I mean everything in his power to sign Vilakazi. He is not prepared to lose him to Sundowns."Bobby also has his sights set on Anele Ngcongca. He has been telling a few people that there will be a surprise signing at the back," disclosed a Chiefs insider.Sundowns have also sounded out Ngcongca, 28, about his availability.Coach Pitso Mosimane and his assistant Rhulani Mokoena had talks with the defender in Durban when he was in the country for the penultimate, dead rubber 2017 Africa Nations Cup qualifier against Cameroon in March.The snag is that the player, who is back at his Belgian club Genk after a season-long loan spell at French Ligue 1 club Troyes, wants something in the region of R6 million a year.A Sundowns source told the Sunday Times: "Let me put it to you this way: the Sundowns of three or four years ago would have paid that money, easy."Even the R10-million Wits want for Vilakazi. But not now. Things have changed."The days of spending for the sake of it are over."In any case we still managed to win a double last season without shelling out a lot of money."Desperately in demand at Chiefs is a top-notch playmaker and match- winner extraordinaire to give the team verve.In order to rekindle an aura of invincibility, Amakhosi are crying out for a formidable figure.Absent is a nucleus which coach Steve Komphela can use as a catalyst to reconstruct the team anew and arrest the apparent decrease in vigour.It has to be someone who, at the mere mention of his name, can send shivers down the spines of the opponents.Vilakazi can inject that and more: Vivacity. Star quality.At Chiefs Vilakazi will find a side where he will not struggle to storm into the starting XI.On the contrary, a galaxy of stars is what he will find were he to choose crossing the floor to Chloorkop.Let's take just one example, that of Botswana international Ngele.One of the first names coach Cavin Johnson pencilled in his starting XI at previous employer Platinum Stars, he has found the going tough at Downs.The man who can twist and turn like a snake on a hot desert surface and score beautiful goals to boot, largely watched from the bench or the stands as the men from Mamelodi marauded their way to the championship in record- breaking fashion the season past.Discontent at being a peripheral figure, Ngele is itching for action.Sundowns are loathe to lose him.Truth be told, no player, on current form, can unseat man-of-the-moment Khama Billiat, the hottest property on the domestic soccer scene by a long mile.To borrow from the lexicon of the young generation, Zimbabwe international Billiat is lit and on fleek #khamaisthebest.Breaking into their formidable frontline has proved a mountain to climb for Ngele. Vilakazi may find himself joining that queue.Even if Mosimane were to get Vilakazi now, he would play no role in the pursuit of the Confederation of African Football Champions League glory. Vilakazi is cup-tied having played in the Caf Confederation Cup for Wits this year.Moreover, because they have no off-season break, Sundowns are playing continuously.That means they are gelling into a tighter unit with every game.If rotation is not on Mosimane's agenda, the waiting game may not be an option for Vilakazi.The flip side of the coin is that the exertions of Caf commitments will result in fatigue, making it easy for Ngele and Vilakazi - should Sundowns win his signature. The coming weeks will tell which direction Vilakazi will go. Naturena Village or Chloorkop.bbk@sundaytimes.co.za
