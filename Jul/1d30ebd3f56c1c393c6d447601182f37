The Highlanders' 15-9 win over the Brumbies in their quarterfinal in Canberra on Friday continued a dominant Super Rugby season for New Zealand teams over their Australian opposition, winning 22 of their 26 encounters."We dug in over the last 15 minutes and showed good character," Otago skipper Shane Christie said. "It was always going to be difficult coming over here but we're stoked and we're in the semifinals now and we look forward to the week ahead."It was a despondent Brumbies camp, bowing out of the finals race and saying goodbye to three of their star Wallabies, skipper Stephen Moore, Matt Toomua and David Pocock, who will all be heading elsewhere next season."It's difficult not to comment on some of those refereeing decisions," Brumbies coach Stephen Larkham said. "For me, Lausii [Taliauli] scored a try near the end and we had a dominant scrum all night and the ball has come out sideways in the final minutes and I cannot see how there is no penalty for that."It's really devastating because it is tough conditions tonight [on Friday] and we were behind on the scoreboard but we found a way back into the game and we did everything right to win it."Hurricanes blow away Sharks to reach Super Rugby semis"Disappointing! We had our chances there at the end but just could not get across the line," said captain Moore, who played his last match for the Brumbies before leaving for Queensland next season. "It was a tight game in tough conditions but it comes down to those small moments. You've got to take every opportunity and we didn't."HIGHLIGHTS1. Try or no try?The Brumbies looked like clinching one of the great knockout wins when replacement winger Taliauli barged over the line in the 73rd minute off the back of a scrum.The TMO review though showed no conclusive evidence of the ball touching down, despite much of Taliauli's body going over the line.Moore said after the game he thought it showed enough to be a score and the team's reaction at the time indicated the same.They would have needed a conversion to actually clinch the victory but the tough decision will be one dissected for days to come.The Brumbies continued to fight through to the 85th minute before the heartbreaking conclusion came.2. Trans-Tasman dominance ends Australian chancesAs well as ending any chance of an Australian team challenging for the Super Rugby title, the Brumbies' quarterfinal loss ends a lopsided season when it comes to the Australia-New Zealand rivalry.In all, Australian sides won just three of their encounters against Kiwi teams this season, a statistic that hangs over the 2016 Super Rugby campaign.No Australian side has managed to win across the ditch and the Brumbies' round one thrashing of the Hurricanes remains their only trans-Tasman victory.3. Defence, defence, defenceIt was their defence that cost them against the Highlanders in round 10 but the Brumbies wouldn't let history repeat itself on Friday night.On the wrong end of an early 93-7 territory count, the home side kept the Highlanders out for most of the first half, making 64 tackles to 17 in the opening 40 minutes.Ultimately the Highlanders pounced on an overlap and an intercept for their two tries of the match, but this could have all been over before the break if not for the Brumbies' tenacity.It was a gritty effort from the Brumbies, who didn't leave their season to chance.4. Brumbies take the scrum battleThe set-piece battle is what the Brumbies love and they exerted their dominance early on in the match.But it wasn't in the lineout where they found most success, rather the scrum that heaped the pressure on their opponents.They had the first two scrum penalties of the match and deep in Highlanders territory another helped the Brumbies out of danger.It very nearly helped them to an unlikely victory in the final few minutes.5. Premiership window closed?This was supposed to be the Brumbies' year, not that sport ever really delivers the narrative you expect. Bowing out of the finals in the first week signalled a disappointing end for a handful of Brumbies stalwarts.The reflection might not come for a couple of days, the next question is what next year will be and whether they will have to start over with Moore, Toomua, Pocock and Joe Tomane all leaving Canberra next year.
