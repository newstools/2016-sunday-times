Province beat the Golden Lions 27-20 at Kearsney College in Durban for their third main game win in four years.It also capped a dominant showing from the various Western Province teams in the various youth teams this month as their under-13 and under-18 Academy sides won their respective tournaments.Earlier in the week Province dispatched Boland 41-20 and the Sharks 60-5, while the Lions got to their first main game in three years with convincing wins over the Eagles (59-26) and the Blue Bulls (41-14). Stop the exodus: politics driving rugby players outProvince's Salman Moerat, Muller Uys, Athi Magwala and Khanya Ncusane were immense and should be South African Schools candidates when the side is picked this week.For all their dominance, Province should have had more than a 10-point lead. This was due to excellent defence by the Lions and youthful exuberance getting the better of Theuns van Schoor's team.However, tries by the effervescent outside centre Manny Rass and blindside flanker Uys in the 15th and 28th minutes made sure their territorial possession was taken advantage of.While the Lions and Jeppe Boys High creative hub of flyhalf Tyrone Green and Wandisile Simelane were kept on a tight leash, the former was able to glide through for the Lions' sole first-half try in the 23rd minute.The Lions looked to have a way back early when Monument forward Cristen van Niekerk intercepted Lombard's pass before he offloaded to Tatenda Mujawo from St Benedict's to score in the 36th minute.However, Lombard made up for his mistake two minutes later when his jinxing run and superb cut-out pass put through Paarl Boys High teammate and eighthman Ncusane for the easiest of tries.With the strong wind at their backs in the second half, the Lions did their best to crack the Western Province defence, but they were pinned deep in their half for large stretches.While Lombard missed a late penalty, their defensive fortitude saw them through.
