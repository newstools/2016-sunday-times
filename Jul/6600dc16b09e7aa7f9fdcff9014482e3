But there are enough signs out there that dodgy politicians are far from the only rogues in our midst.Just last week we learnt that margarine and cooking oil maker Sime Darby Hudson &amp; Knight had agreed to pay a R35-million fine for colluding with Unilever.The Competition Commission said the company had entered into a collusive agreement to focus on large industrial customers, leaving retail customers to Unilever. In doing so, the cartel denied end consumers choice on supermarket shelves and the benefit of lower prices.Power Report: Why checklists matter when talking dents and sensibilityIn another equally unsavoury scandal, an undisclosed number of consumers just got taken for an undisclosed amount of money for mobile content services they didn't subscribe to.The vagueness is frightening, more so after a major industry player described the scam this week as a "potentially very serious economic crime on a potentially very large scale".You'd be hard pressed to believe that, however. On Wednesday, the Wireless Application Service Providers' Association (Waspa) lifted its two-week temporary suspension of the offending member.So after being associated with a "cynical and criminal attempt to make money at the expense of the consumer", the member, Infobip, a leading provider of mobile messaging services for various clients, including 150 banks and telecoms operators worldwide, is back in business.The suspension of Infobip's membership, ordered by an independent Waspa emergency panel hastily convened, was done because there was "a high likelihood of considerable harm to the public if these actions are not stopped".It followed complaints, prompted by the association's media monitor (and apparently Vodacom), about the illegal practice of auto-subscription, whereby consumers are secretly subscribed to a content service they didn't ask for. So these networks billed customers, took their cut, but have no clue which of their customers were affected? In a nutshell, Infobip (or its client) tricked cellphone users browsing at least two adult sites into subscribing to a R5-a-day content service.The network confirmation page, part of all mobile networks' double opt-in facility, was fraudulently hidden from consumers who were none the wiser until they received a message saying they were subscribed.More alarming is that the fraudsters also fooled the network confirmation page into reporting that the consumer had confirmed the subscription.Power Report: Long walk to delivery for coin collectorThe networks' introduction of double opt-in a few years ago - whereby consumers have to confirm consent to the network before billing can proceed - has significantly reduced unauthorised billing.The duping of a network system designed to protect consumers is concerning.Of course, the networks have moved quickly to suspend the services (Ultra Joy and Xoxo Charm) and plug the holes.Vodacom told me: "Both services offer adult content and have been active on our network since August 2015 and January 2016," and it was making "security enhancement features" to its confirmation page.MTN has "deployed a defence mechanism" to ensure a Wasp cannot illegally hide MTN's content subscription approval page under its webpage while a customer browses.CellC has taken "additional security measures".Telkom said its customers were unaffected by the fraud.But why can nobody tell me how many consumers are affected? Vodacom and CellC are still investigating; MTN says the nature of the fraud means it won't know which customers have been defrauded until they complain. Seriously.So these networks were able to bill customers for the service, take their cut of the revenue (anything from 30 to 60%), but have no clue which of their customers were affected?As for the amount swindled, it's all still under investigation, the networks say. At least one, MTN, is hiding behind "confidentiality obligations".As for criminal charges, who knows who'll lay them, when or at all. But the networks say they'll terminate all services to Infobip depending on their own investigations.Power Report: Turn up or pay up, restaurants ruleInfobip, meanwhile, is shifting the blame. Marketing manager Martina Dodic says the Waspa suspension related to a "service operated by a third party" and that Infobip was "merely an intermediary" and wrongly targeted."As this is an investigation being undertaken by Waspa, it would be inappropriate for us to comment further," said Dodic in response to my detailed list of questions.She declined to name the third party, for legal reasons, but claimed it was a Waspa member and is now under investigation by Waspa.Waspathis week declined to discuss specific details of the "ongoing investigation" pending the outcome of the formal complaints process.Other than the sanctions that will inevitably come, I'm looking forward to the clarity the final adjudication will provide.So far, MTN refers to the fraud as "clickjacking", Waspa says it's a "form" of clickjacking, and Vodacom says it is not clickjacking at all.So what's the way forward for consumers?There's little you can do to avoid falling victim to such malicious fraud (and don't be fooled into thinking it's limited to X-rated sites), but you would do well to regularly check your subscription status with your network (see box for tips) and insist on refunds where due. How to protect yourself Take advantage of network options to unsubscribe from Wasp subscription services.To terminate subscriptions with Vodacom, send "stop all" to 30333, for MTN dial *141*5#, and for CellC deactivate subscriptions and blacklist new Wasp services by dialling *133*1#. Contact the networks for more details. Don't ignore messages saying you are subscribed to a particular service and giving you an option to unsubscribe. If you're getting "welcome" messages, you're being billed. Check your cellphone statements for content charges; if you're on prepaid, monitor your balance. Be mobile-savvy; think twice before entering your cell number and beware of clicking on banners and links without reading the fine print. Many are subscription services, albeit legitimate ones.
