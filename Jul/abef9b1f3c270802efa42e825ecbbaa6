The Hurricanes turned a perceived midfield weakness into a strength with Jason Woodward and Willis Halaholo scoring two of their of five tries. Replacement flanker Callum Gibbins then put them into bonus-point territory with 10 minutes left.Both sides were forced into late replacements before the match. The Crusaders lost Sam Whitelock and Andy Ellis during the warm-up, and the Hurricanes had to rush Woodward onto the field at outside centre for Ngani Laumape - already an injury replacement for Matt Proctor. STOP THE EXODUSWoodward scored the first try, running off a Beauden Barrett pass to finish off an attack on the Crusaders line.A Richie Mo'unga penalty eventually put the home side on the board and he also converted a Ryan Crotty try for the Crusaders to lead 10-7. But on the stroke of half time scrumhalf TJ Perenara charged down a clearing kick by opposite Mitchell Drummond to regain the lead for the Hurricanes.The Hurricanes held a slender 14-10 lead at half time and Halaholo proved the game-breaker 15 minutes into the second half. In a rare opportunity as a starting player to replace the injured Vince Aso, Halaholo bumped off an ineffectual tackle by Crotty to score under the posts.Barrett landed the conversion to give the Hurricanes a 10-point buffer and they followed with tries to Gibbins. That gave them the bonus-point three-try advantage before Barrett put the icing on the cake with a try.Rebels spoil Reds' big dayThe Rebels ruined the farewell celebrations of a host of Queensland stalwarts when they held off the Reds 31-28 in their Super Rugby match in Brisbane on Friday.The Reds were saying goodbye to a host of Wallaby stars, including Greg Holmes, Liam Gill, Saia Fainga'a and Ben Daley, in front of their home crowd at Suncorp Stadium.But the Rebels spoilt the party when they raced to a 24-7 half-time lead and held on to win despite the Reds' three converted tries.The Rebels opened the scoring in the second minute when outstanding flanker Sean McMahon broke the line and gave winger Tom English a clear run to the line. Flyhalf Jack Debreczeni converted the try and kicked a penalty 10 minutes later.The Reds opened their account with a Nick Frisby try, but McMahon then scored two to give the Rebels a comfortable lead at halftime.The Reds were much better after the break and closed to within three points when first Gill and then Samu Kerevi took advantage of a wealth of possession and territory.But almost from the kick-off after Kerevi's try, Rebels skipper Stirzaker charged down Duncan Paia'aua's attempted clearance and regathered to give the Rebels a 10-point buffer.The Reds hit back with a second try to Gill but the Rebels held on to win their seventh match of the season, a record for them.
