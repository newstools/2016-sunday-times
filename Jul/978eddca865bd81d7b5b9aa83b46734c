Two of those were in the amateur era when current Lions chief executive Rudolf Straeuli was still a bullocking No8.It highlights the depths the Lions plumbed in the professional era after the heady days of Louis Luyt's reign in the mid to late 90s.Having not hosted a Super Rugby playoff since the game turned professional, consecutive playoff weekends is something Lions fans had to adapt to.The manner in which these occasions have been embraced has showed how hungry the fans have been for success.It was only a good six years ago when the Lions lost all their regular season games and conceded the most points in a season.Only the most faithful of Lions supporters dared to show their faces above the parapet or be associated with the team.What used to be the scene of repeated culling of Lions in the past heaved in expectation for a team that has successfully reinvented itself over the past two seasons.They never tried to be friendly with the visitors and at every given opportunity they made it clear that this was Ellis Park.Each try, piece of magic and big hit was greeted with a bellow that is unique to the stadium.
