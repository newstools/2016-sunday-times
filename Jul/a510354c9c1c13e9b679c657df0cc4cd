Re-established as favourites to win the tournament given their favourable draw, the danger is that they fall into the same trap as England.Iceland's last-16 victory will go down as one of the greatest upsets in European Championship history, though that game proved that this Iceland side have made it this far on merit, the Guardian in the UK reported this week. France have struggled to meet expectations and are the only side in the tournament who have not scored in the first half of a game. They came from behind against the Republic of Ireland in the last-16 match after coach Didier Deschamps pushed Antoine Griezmann closer to Olivier Giroud and will look to get Griezmann on the ball more, the paper said.France would be well advised to wake up early when they face Iceland, veteran defender Patrice Evra warned."We keep scaring ourselves, we're crazy," Evra said."If we keep doing that, we might not go through. We need to stop reacting and start acting."Evra, who has won plenty of silverware at club level but has never gone beyond the quarterfinals of a major event with France, nodded when asked whether today's tie at the Stade de France might be the most important game in his career."Yes, that's true," said the Juventus player, in line to win his 78th cap against Iceland."I can't stop there, we can't stop there. We all know what we're here for.""Uncle" Evra, as his teammates affectionately call him, urged the France players not to underestimate Iceland, who advanced with a shock 2-1 win over England.And Deschamps is not taking his opponents for granted, keeping his players out of the spotlight amid mounting expectations ahead of today's game, trying to ensure nothing derails their progress.Instead, the former French captain focused on overcoming Les Bleus' remaining hurdles as they seek to join Spain and Germany as three-time winners of the European Championship. Deschamps appears set to hand Lyon defender Samuel Umtiti, a new signing for Barcelona, his international debut in place of the suspended Adil Rami.But perhaps of more pressing concern is the form of Juventus star Paul Pogba, who has flattered to deceive despite an impressive first half in the 0-0 draw with Switzerland in the group stage.Deschamps also must decide who replaces N'Golo Kante after the Leicester City midfielder picked up his second booking of the tournament in the last-16 victory over the Republic of Ireland.Kingsley Coman returned to training on Wednesday after hurting his ankle at the weekend and the Bayern Munich youngster is in contention to start.Moussa Sissoko is also an option after seizing his opportunity against the Swiss, while Yohan Cabaye represents another alternative in defensive midfield if the 47-year-old Deschamps elects to go with a 4-3-3 set-up.Aside from Griezmann, Dimitri Payet is the other Frenchman to have caught the eye this summer after his stunning late winner against Romania was followed up with another last-gasp goal against Albania.Payet wasn't even in Deschamps' plans as recently as eight months ago, but the West Ham playmaker's electrifying form made it impossible to overlook him."When he wasn't in the French team he never gave up, and now he is proving he is one of the most important and talented players, not just in the French side, but in Europe," said French legend and Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane, in quotes that were published by the Daily Mirror last week."He had an incredible season with West Ham, and now at the Euros is showing that no occasion is too big for him. He would improve any side in Europe, that is how talented he is."
