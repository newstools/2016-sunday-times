So said Heimir Hallgrimsson, who combines his role as co-coach alongside Lars Lagerback with his job as a dentist, after the nation of 330000 and 80-1 outsiders, making their first appearance at a major tournament, shocked the world by sending the founding fathers of football back home in disgrace."The pressure was always so much more on England - that was a game for them to lose," said Hallgrimsson, adding: "It's exactly the same against France." Hallgrimsson has described the stunning victory in Iceland's first appearance at a major tournament as "life-changing" and says his minnows will head to Paris in the same spirit.He hopes the pressure on manager Didier Deschamps' France to beat unfancied Iceland will play into his hands again."When you can go into a game like that, you just need to show what you can do - relax and enjoy doing your best," he said."We don't have the pressure of the world [on us] that we need to win the game."Euro 2016 fever has gripped the tiny Nordic nation and a big chunk of the 330000 population is in France supporting their team.Iceland's co-coaches are in a relaxed frame of mind and there was plenty of laughing in a press conference this week, which opened with Hallgrimsson jokingly asking a Swedish reporter about Iceland's chances against France."It's always a benefit to be the underdog," said Lagerback. "France have really high expectations on them [the team]. Just like it was against England, [for them] if you can't beat Iceland, it's not good."Having seen unfancied Leicester City win last season's English Premier League title, Hallgrimsson says the Iceland squad also benefit from playing without the pressure of expectations."I really would like things to end like they did with Leicester City, if you want to talk about them," he said."They played to their strengths and that is what we are trying to do. There is the same sort of team spirit. Maybe the players have less individual quality."If you compare the French to us, most of their players play regular Champions League football while few of ours have ever done."Lagerback will step down after Euro 2016, with Hallgrimsson becoming head coach, and the pair are revelling in their success.But they are fully aware of the task ahead. The heat is on The heat is on for France"The French keep on going until the end, because they have a lot of possession and tire their opponents out," said Hallgrimsson."They tend to hit their opponents with late goals, which shows us that we have to concentrate for the full 90 minutes."With swelling numbers of Iceland fans set to descend on Paris for today's match at the Stade de France, media have dubbed it "the continuing Viking invasion".The last time Vikings came to Paris, France's modern-day capital was held under siege from 885-886 after Nordic warriors sailed up the Seine.Hallgrimsson says today's next invasion of Paris by Nordic football fans promises to be a much more peaceful affair, when asked by a French reporter."I have to be honest, I know nothing about the Viking invasion of Paris, it couldn't have been many of them and maybe they were Swedish," he said with a grin - looking directly at Iceland's Swedish co-coach Lagerback.
