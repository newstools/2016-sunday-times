You need enough time to find a pair that is not only comfortable but also makes you look and feel good.2) Play around with sizesThe idea that you have one definitive fit for all denim makes is a myth. Sizes vary between manufacturers and styles. When you are looking at a specific style, try on two different sizes. Don't be afraid to ask a shop assistant for help if you are not sure how to convert UK and US sizes.The Denim Awards: Our top 16 picks3) Explore different shades of blueDifferent shades and washes work for different occasions.
