Finding themselves in a group with Brazil, China and Sweden is akin to being up the creek without a paddle.This is a group where the best any national women's team can do is to glean positives and hope they will score goals.Their opening assignment is against Sweden at the Joao Havelange Olympic Stadium in Rio de Janeiro on Wednesday.The same opponents beat them 4-1 at the City of Coventry Stadium in the previous Olympiad, but that is a game Banyana remembers for all the right reasons.Striker Portia Modise's stunning long-range effort and Amanda Sister's excellent defensive display were the highlights of what was an exploratory outing. Khune criticism is pure jealousy: MotaungBut the team has moved on from there as Noko Matlou has ably filled the defensive void left by the tactically astute Sister.Modise retired after the disappointing 2014 African Women's Championship campaign in Namibia, while Sister has never been a favourite of coach Vera Pauw.The 4-1 reverse at the hands of New Zealand in their warm-up game on Thursday seems to have left Pauw in no doubt about the task that lies ahead over the next three matches.While it is clear her side is competitive, the fact they have lost four consecutive matches (2-0 and 1-0) to the Netherlands and (1-0) to the US puts their position into perspective.There was a measure of improvement in those games defensively, but the teams making up Banyana's group are far superior to New Zealand. There is also the small matter of having to deal with a Brazilian team that will be high on home support and looking to improve their underwhelming record at Olympics.For all their talent, the closest they have come to the gold medal was in the 2008 Beijing, China, edition when they were beaten by the US. It was the same case at the 2004 Athens, Greece, game when the US again pipped them to the post.Their slow decline was complete when they were ejected at the quarterfinal stage four years ago by Japan, who eventually ended up as silver medallists.The best South Africa can hope for is to arm themselves with lessons they can take forward for their continental battles as their fight to qualify for the women's World Cup continues.Their qualification, along with Zimbabwe's, cannot be underestimated as teams like Nigeria, Cameroon and the Ivory Coast have to watch from the sidelines.With the likes of Matlou, Janine van Wyk, Amanda Dlamini and Mpumi Nyandeni, they have an experienced core that is hungry to make up for the disappointment of missing out on last year's World Cup.For the majority of that lot who all have more than 100 international caps, this could effectively be their swansong.
