Cane's intercepted pass enabled Hurricanes flyhalf Beauden Barrett to sprint clear for a counter-attacking try in the 34th minute and the back-rower then conceded an unnecessary penalty that led to Victor Vito's second- half touchdown.The Chiefs dominated the set- piece for a majority of the contest as the Hurricanes played without influential captain Dane Coles, but explosive line speed and a ferocious defence kept the home side in the match.They also took whatever scoring opportunities that came their way with Barrett also slotting 10 points with the boot after Willis Halaholo had opened the scoring in the sixth minute by finishing off a move set up by the flyhalf's kick and chase.Chiefs fullback Damian McKenzie slotted three penalties for the visitors, who were unable to capitalise on numerous try-scoring opportunities.The Hurricanes, who had been heavily penalised by referee Angus Gardner, also spent 10 second-half minutes reduced to 14 men after winger Cory Jane was yellow-carded for a deliberate knockdown.Neither side were really able to stamp their authority on the contest in the first quarter until McKenzie put the Chiefs on the board with a penalty soon after Halaholo's try and the hosts were then placed under siege in their own 22-metre area.A try-saving tackle by captain TJ Perenara on McKenzie, however, relieved the pressure and the home side jumped to a 15-3 lead on Barrett's first penalty and his intercept try.
