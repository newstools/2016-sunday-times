Written off by Cristiano Ronaldo as having a "small mentality", Iceland have struck it big at Euro 2016.The smallest ever nation to have qualified for the European Championship flexed its muscles at the championships to secure a historic last-16 tie against England after claiming its maiden victory against Austria this week.The saga of Iceland's path to these finals and how a nation of 330000 upset all the odds has been one of the European Championship's most enchanting tales.Much scorn has been poured upon the decision to increase the competition from 16 to 24 teams, but Iceland's arrival on the world stage has given romantics reason to dream once again.After qualifying in a group in which it defeated Netherlands twice, few were going to take Iceland lightly, but the team's performances have been hugely impressive for a group of players who have never experienced the pressures of tournament football. Tough for SA, but not the worst drawAnd, tomorrow, the Icelandic capital of Reykjavik faces another shutdown as the nation's Euro 2016 saga continues to unfold with a knockout tie against England in Nice.The joy of the nation is summed up in a viral video of Icelandic TV commentator Gudmundur Benediktsson as Elmar Bjarnason, whom the commentator referred to by his nickname Emmi, broke free in injury time against the Austrians."Three against two! Emmi! Get into the penalty area, get into the penalty area!" he implored, before screaming joyously as Arnor Traustason fired home the decisive goal."Yes, Yes, Yes! We have won! We are now in last 16! My voice has gone, but it doesn't matter because we are going through! We have won against Austria!"For Iceland, which suffered enormously following the global financial crisis in 2008, the exploits of the football team are a welcome good news story in a country that has struggled to get itself back on track.Financing for football has been ring-fenced and fans expect that there will be even greater investment following their successful showing at the Euros.So as they now take the field against the heavyweights, the tournament enters the exciting knockout rounds with plenty of Europe's big guns still in the competition and eyeing silverware.We take a closer look at the remaining fixtures:France v Republic of IrelandFrance's progress in the tournament has more to do with Dimitri Payet than anyone else. His two goals helped Les Bleus dispatch Romania and Albania to leave the hosts sitting top of Group A.Changing the guard: New dawn for AmakhosiThe West Ham United star was left on the bench for the goalless draw against Switzerland but once on, he was only denied a winner by the crossbar.The French have undoubted individual quality throughout the squad but manager Didier Deschamps is struggling to find a system that creates goals. Sound familiar, England fans? He will hope home support can give his side the edge.Ireland, meanwhile, left it late to secure their progression , but an 85th-minute header from Robbie Brady helped secure an historic victory over confirmed Group E winners Italy.The previous two games had seen Ireland denied by an own goal against Sweden and blown away by Belgium.But their fully deserved win over Italy offers hope to their many travelling fans that Ireland can pull off another big result against the tournament hosts.Germany v SlovakiaGermany are aiming to emulate Spain and France and lift the European Championship trophy while World Cup holders - but will face a tough test against Slovakia.With wins over Ukraine and Northern Ireland, plus a 0-0 draw against Poland, the Germans have been workmanlike rather than spectacular but now they are into the knockout rounds, many expect Joachim Low's side to step up.Slovakia began the tournament with a 2-1 defeat to Wales.A very impressive win over Russia followed, before a determined, defensive display against England ensured they secured qualifying spot.Slovakia's backline will be extensively tested once again when they meet the Germans. Bafana Bafana get their mojo backHungary v BelgiumBefore Euro 2016, Hungary received more coverage for their decision to include veteran goalkeeper Gabor Kiraly in their starting lineup than for their chances of progressing into the last 16 - but it was the 40-year-old's team who were laughing as they began the competition with a 2-0 win over Austria.A late own goal saw them claim a point against Iceland, before an epic 3-3 draw with Portugal, during which they relinquished the lead on three occasions, saw them top Group F on goal difference.Hungary will now face star-studded Belgium in the last 16, whose false start against Italy, a 2-0 defeat, left them bottom of their group after the opening game.They made amends against the Republic of Ireland, though, with Everton striker Romelu Lukaku scoring twice as they secured a 3-0 win, before confining Zlatan Ibrahimovic's Sweden to an early plane home.Their 1-0 victory over the Swedes qualified Belgium in second place.Less-fancied teams have already pulled off a number of shock results in this tournament, but the talented Belgians will be the clear favourites among the pundits to progress into the quarterfinals.Italy v SpainGroup E was supposed to be the "group of death" but Antonio Conte's men not only finished top, but won it with a game to spare.Built on the solid foundations of Juventus' Gigi Buffon, Giorgio Chiellini, Leonardo Bonucci and Andrea Barzagli, the Italians kept clean sheets in their first two group games, before losing their third 1-0 to Ireland.The defending champions, Spain, may have suffered a shock defeat to Croatia, but still look strong enough to go far in the tournament, with Alvaro Morata netting three goals already.Victories over the Czech Republic and Turkey preceded their first defeat in the Euros since 2004, but Spain will be refocused for this mouthwatering clash with Italy. Safa silences Tovey's TV-show criticsEngland v IcelandThroughout their Group B campaign England played attacking football, dominated the midfield and defended resolutely enough. So how did they finish second in the group? By not taking their chances.The Three Lions have had 64 attempts at goal but have only scored three goals in draws against Russia and Slovakia and a last-minute win over Wales. Against Iceland, England will need to improve their accuracy.The Euro's smallest nation, Iceland have been perhaps its biggest surprise.Following their high-profile 1-1 draw against Portugal, they were two minutes from securing a victory against Hungary in their first ever tournament, only to fall victim to a Birkir Saevarsson own goal, which cancelled out Gylfi Sigurdsson's earlier penalty.They weren't to be denied, however, as an injury-time winner against Austria gave them the win at last and simultaneously forced Portugal down to third spot in Group F, to set up a tie between the Nordic side and England.* Catch all 51 Uefa Euro matches live, in HD, on SuperSport June 10 July 10
