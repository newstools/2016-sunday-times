Rose, who was the subject of a sex assault complaint while living in the country, told Television New Zealand yesterday he was racially stereotyped by police.The sex-assault investigation was eventually dropped with no charges laid and the 44-year-old was deported in April for overstaying his visa having spent his final weeks in prison.Rose, who played 19 tests for the West Indies from 1997-2000 and is now back in Jamaica, had been in New Zealand since 2011 on a work visa, to play and coach in Auckland."You cannot invite someone to your country to play and coach cricket, then throw him in jail for no reason, then kick him out of your country," he said. "What have I done to be locked in a prison cell for seven weeks? I felt so terrified and nervous when I realised I was living with and among serial killers, rapists and drug dealers." Paralympics leader Leon is in it for the loveRose said he has written to the International Cricket Council stating: "New Zealand is not a safe place for international cricketers, especially if they are black."He said he would have left New Zealand earlier had he not landed in hospital after being assaulted in November 2012.While in hospital recovering from his wounds, he developed a blood clot in his lungs which prevented him from flying, he said, saying this was why he stayed in the country as long as he did.Police superintendent Bill Searle said police "strongly refute" Rose's claim that the assault was not investigated properly, and that the investigating officer "racially stereotyped" him."A full and thorough investigation was carried out into Mr Rose's reported assault," Searle said."Mr Rose's version of events was not able to be corroborated. Mr Rose was advised of the outcome of his case and thanked the investigating officer."Searle said Rose never complained to the police about his treatment and later "extended an invitation to the investigating officer to bring other members of police to attend a promotional event at a bar".Searle also confirmed that the cricketer "was the subject of a police investigation earlier this year, in relation to sexual assault."No charges were laid. However, in early April officers from the NZ police assisted with Mr Rose's deportation back to Jamaica."
