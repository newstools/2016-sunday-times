For the dad who uses a 9-in-1 productStill not using moisturiser? Give him a mini Dermalogica Skin Kit, R850, to get him started on a new routine. The kit includes Special Cleansing Gel, Skin Prep Scrub, Multi Active Toner, Active Moist and Total Eye Care with an SPF15. If he likes it (we think he will), he can graduate to the full-size products.How about an in-spa treatment?Most guys are a little nervous of going to a spa or salon for a massage, but this won t be the case with Sorbet Man. They re well priced and are popping up all over the place, so treat dad to a voucher for a hot shave or haircut. Plus, they re running a competition: Book a Dad &amp; Dude Haircut Combo (R290) until June 19, and you can win a Lion Park Adventure. And on Father s Day itself snacks, beers and give-aways come standard with your treatment.Manscaping trend spurs gents to get their groom onHas he stopped shaving to grow a beard?Buy him a beard oil to moisturise and nourish the hair and skin, keeping them soft, supple and non-scratchy. Plus, they are scented with essential oils. We like Proraso Beard Oil, R199 from Sorbet Man. Does he match his socks with his boxers?Then get him a matching deodorant and shower gel duo. This layering of scents will keep him smelling fresh all day. One of our favourites is the new Dior Sauvage Shower Gel, R580 and Deodorant Stick, R555. Is he more of a clean-shaven guy?If he is, then an old-school matching shaving brush and soap bowl is a winner. Aesop Shaving Brush, R950, and Shaving Bowl, R350, are a little more luxurious than usual but oh-so-superb.Beauty and grooming with Rharha Nembhard and Petite NoirLastly, add a fresh, invigorating scentIf he loves a vibrant and light cologne, Azzaro Chrome is a great choice. The cologne, R925 for 100ml, lasts for ages and the scent includes notes of neroli, coriander and sandalwood.
