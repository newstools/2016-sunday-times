The Premier Soccer League's Executive Committee also seems unlikely to stand in the way.Questions have been raised about why AmaZulu's attempt to buy Aces' PSL status a year ago was blocked by the exco, and this sale appears set to be approved.It has been reported that the deal has been approved, but Sunday Times was unable to find anyone at the PSL to confirm this.A source at the PSL said with the current deal any company has the right to be sold to an individual in terms of SA's Companies Act. Raid on Fifa amid enrichment claims"It's a situation where an individual or a consortium of individuals are buying a company," said the source, who did not want to be named."The terms of the laws of SA can't stop people buying companies. And there's only one thing in the PSL constitution governing that - the majority shareholder, or 51%, must be South African."The problem with relegated AmaZulu's attempt to buy Aces was apparently that this was submitted by both clubs as a swap deal, contravening Article 30.1.1 of the PSL's constitution.This states: "The right of a club to membership of the League and to play in a particular division of the League is inextricably bound to that club and may not be sold or transferred to any other legal entity."Now that he has acquired Aces, former Ajax boss Comitis wants to move the club to his Cape Town base and rename it as soon as possible.On Friday night, Comitis said Muhsin Ertugral, who guided Aces to a best finish of fourth in the past season and worked with Comitis at Ajax, would stay on as coach.Amakhosi RevolutionComitis stated: "I can confirm that the club will be based in Cape Town as of the new season, 2016-2017. Pre-season training will commence in the city mid-June. My business strengths and vision and infrastructure are totally Cape Town-based."The constitution of the PSL says nothing about a time period from when a club is acquired to when it can relocate. All that is needed is the approval of the exco.Article 31 states: "A club may not change its name without the written approval of the Executive Committee. This approval must be ratified by the annual, quadrennial or special general meeting."A club will not change its home venue or relocate without the prior written approval of the League."Maritzburg United had to retain the name Tembisa Classic after acquiring that franchise in the 2005-06 season and relocating it to Pietermaritzburg. But the purchase was only concluded two weeks and four matches into the season.John Comitis and brother George sold their shares in Ajax in 2013 after a family feud with fellow shareholders Ari, Alex and Nick.
