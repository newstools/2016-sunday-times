The mercurial midfielder, who created the first goal before firing the clincher in the 89th minute in the hosts' 2-1 Group A victory over a stubborn Romania, was until recently a peripheral player in the mind of France coach Didier Deschamps."To be here tonight and score is the result of a lot of hard work and a lot of sacrifices," the 29-year-old Payet said of his long road back from the international wilderness."To be honest, compared to some players, I honestly didn't think I would be here today at the start of the season," added the West Ham United player."There was some pressure arriving at the stadium, but I came to enjoy myself." That pressure was the result of a prolonged period in the international doldrums when Payet was ignored by Deschamps and often told he had slipped too far down the pecking order to be worthy of a spot in the squad. Spain out to three-peatDespite playing reasonably well and scoring his first goal for France in a 4-3 defeat by Belgium in June 2015, the 29-year-old was dropped from subsequent squads.Undoubtedly talented, questions remained over his ability to fit into the France team and how to get the best out of him.Not even an excellent start to the English Premier League season at his new club West Ham helped his international career.Payet made little effort to hide his frustration at being overlooked by Deschamps, saying on one occasion: "Honestly, I am struggling to understand what he is really asking of me."But his persistence paid off and he was finally welcomed back into the French fold in March, just in time to force his way into the reckoning for the Euros.A superb display on his return against the Netherlands in March, and an unstoppable free kick in the final minute of a 3-2 victory over Cameroon in a May friendly, finally convinced Deschamps and Payet was brought back into the squad.At the Stade de France on Friday, he stepped out of the shadow of Paul Pogba and stole the show, creating a slew of chances for his side before eventually serving up the cross that allowed Olivier Giroud to break the deadlock.
