It may have been a dead rubber as the 4-0 victory was just an academic exercise after Bafana's qualifying campaign for Gabon 2017 was rendered null and void by other results.However, Dolly showed his intent to do better in the canary yellow of national colours than his hero and Westbury homeboy Steven Pienaar.Like Pienaar, Dolly has achieved national team captaincy, albeit in the under-23s, whom he will lead to the Rio Olympics in August. I ve read that Pitso s made it clear that he doesn t want Keagan to miss the Olympics. The nation needs Dolly and he needs the Olympics With the opportunity of representing South African age-group teams at the respective tournament being as rare as Halley's Comet, Dolly has a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to grace what effectively is the under-23 World Cup.After all, it has been 16 long years since the under-23s appeared on the Olympic stage and their 3-1 demolition of Brazil is as relevant now as it was on September 17 that year.It is quite ironic and fitting that SA will be meeting Brazil on the opening day of the men's football tournament at the Mane Garrincha National Stadium in Brasilia on August 4. ASA stays in the red despite R3m boonBut while appearing at an Olympics is a dream many will find difficult to turn down, 23-year-old Dolly's talents are required at club level where Mamelodi Sundowns need him for their resuscitated CAF Champions League campaign.With the way Dolly combined with Leonardo Castro and Khama Billiat as the mesmerising "CBD" combination during Sundowns' successful league campaign, navigating the continent without his magical left foot is a coach's worst nightmare.Mosimane and under-23 coach Owen da Gama now need to find a way to get the best out of Dolly without draining him . The Champions League group stages take place from Saturday and end on August 23, conflicting with the Olympics that start on August 4 until August 21.The under-23s are in a difficult group with hosts Brazil, Denmark and Iraq, which makes a group stage exit a possibility. Sundowns have been grouped with Enyimba of Nigeria, Egyptian side Zamalek and ES Setif of Algeria.With preparation camps set to clash with Sundowns' safari, Dolly may be forced to be away from his club at a crucial stage - and former Bafana Bafana left-back David Kannemeyer feels for the midfielder.Kannemeyer was part of the under-23 side that took part in the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games, and said Dolly has a fine line to tread."It's a delicate situation because everyone wants the country to do well at the Olympics, while Sundowns also want to do well in the Champions League," he said."I guess it's up to the club and the country to make a decision, but I don't think there's anything Keagan can do as a player. That's the disadvantage of the Olympic tournament falling outside the Fifa period."At the end of the day, it's the club that pays your salary and it's going to be very difficult for Keagan."Golden Arrows assistant coach Mandla Ncikazi said the country's preference for club football is one of the reasons why there is a wrangle over Dolly's service. Just what the doctor ordered"We're in a peculiar footballing country where we take club football far more seriously than we do the national team. The national team should be above everything else."If Keagan is required by the under-23s, there shouldn't be any negotiations," Ncikazi said.Da Gama has resigned Dolly's fate to the club, but feels there is a solution. With the bulk of Sundowns' continental campaign being next month, the problem will be his availability for training camps.Da Gama feels they can find middle ground, especially with Mosimane's past club-versus-country battles."I've read that Pitso's made it clear that he doesn't want Keagan to miss the Olympics. The nation needs Dolly and he needs the Olympics," he said.Sundowns communications coordinator Thulani Thuswa said Dolly may miss the Cosafa Cup in Namibia because of club commitments but should be available for the Olympics.
