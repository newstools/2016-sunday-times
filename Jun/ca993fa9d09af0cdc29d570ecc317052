1) TRAVELI love travelling, discovering new places and exploring cities. I travel to find beauty, even if it is not the obvious kind. 2) GARDENINGI have an obsession with the citrus gardens of the Medici family in Italy. So much so that I have dedicated almost our entire country garden to citrus trees in terracotta pots. 3) SILENCEIn the search for silence and a quiet retreat, my partner, Hein, and I bought a beautiful old house in the small town of Montagu. It is a place where we find silence, a place to rest and a place that inspires. 4) TRADITIONFor me, tradition places everything into context, and speaks of commitment and pride. The only retail items that we stock in both the restaurant and BASALT, other than the ones we manufacture ourselves, are objects and items that contain the intrinsic values of tradition. 5) MY WORKTo find one's m tier is one of the biggest inspirations in life. I love my work, be it styling, running my restaurant, conceptualising a new project, working with unique clients, creating bespoke interiors, sourcing new and exciting products or creating a quality event. 6) ARTI love art, especially works from the Japanese Gutai Group movement and by artist Kazuo Shiraga. 7) A GOOD FRAGRANCEI am addicted to the perfumes from Kilian, a French luxury brand.
