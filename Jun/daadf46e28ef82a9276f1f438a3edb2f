North still measures its ability against the SouthA fourth Farrell penalty, from a scrum, made it a one-point game again before George shinned the ball over the line and touched down for England's fourth try and when his flyhalf kicked his fifth penalty, the visitors were 41-32 ahead with 13 minutes to go.Another Farrell penalty extended England's record tally and cool game management kept the Australians pinned back until Naiyaravoro crashed over after the hooter for a consolation try.All Blacks pound WalesNew Zealand thrashed Wales with pace and intensity and a masterful performance by Beauden Barrett to sweep the three-test series with a 46-6 victory in Dunedin yesterday.Barrett, in a rare promotion from his regular super-sub role to starting fly-half, commanded a relentless attacking game by the All Blacks as he seamlessly took over from the injured Aaron Cruden. His control in partnership with scrumhalf Aaron Smith allowed Israel Dagg and Ben Smith to make decisive incursions wide out.
