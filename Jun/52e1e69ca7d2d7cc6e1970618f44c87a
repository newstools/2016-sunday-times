Rising star Jane Thabo-Ntso gave Lesotho a first half lead in the quarterfinal before Orlando Pirates forward Gift Motupa equalised in the second half.Motupa was later sent-off as South Africa finished the game with 10 men finally winning the shoot-out as goalkeeper Reyaad Pieterse made two crucial saves.Lesotho had the lead on 19 minutes when one of their stars of this tournament 20-year-old Thabo-Ntso lobbed the ball over Pieterse the South African goalkeeper watched as it nestled in the far corner.South Africa had done most of the pressing to that point but apart from a rasping shot from Motupa that was well-saved by Daniel Jousse had offered little in the way of chances.They had a couple of free-kick chances from good positions wasted by Maphosa Modiba as he blasted over the bar. Coach Shakes Mashaba made a double-change at the break taking off Judas Moseamedi and Thembela Sikhakhane and replacing them with Menzi Masuku and Deolin Mekoa.The balance of the side looked better after that and they did improve in the second period.Motupa put them level with the simplest of headed chances after the impressive Tebogo Moerane found space on the left and his cross sailed over Jousse and left Motupa with the opportunity a yard from goal.South Africa continued to press forward after that but were almost caught out at the back when Thabo-Ntso headed over an on-rushing Pieterse but he put his effort wide of an empty net.South Africa were reduced to 10 men with four minutes remaining as Motupa received a second yellow card to spoil what had been a lively showing from the Pirates man.The game fizzled out towards the end and went to penalties with Lesotho bringing on reserve goalkeeper Liteboho Mokhehle especially for the shoot-out.He saved the first penalty from South African captain Rivaldo Coetzee but his teammates could not capitalise as Pieterse proved the match-winner with fine stops to send South Africa into a semifinal against either Zambia or Swaziland on Wednesday. - TMG Digital
