They say summer bodies are made in winter. Personally, all I want to do is snuggle in bed with a good series rather than do any form of exercise.I had never seen myself as much of an athlete. This was of course before being introduced to the new Nike+ app, which is due to re-launch this month. Through innovation the new Nike+ app specifically allows one to connect with experts, giving you access to incredible experiences, endless motivation and the best of the latest product in tune with your running or training routine.Nike says that each and every one of us is an athlete and that an athlete is not born but rather made. After hearing this I was all ears because for the first time I didn't feel like a misfit in this world of physical activity.Create your own identity with the NIKEiD appNike+ gives you access to the workouts and playlists of some of the world's best athletes and celebrities such as Kevin Hart and Allyson Felix.Along with all of that, Nike+ gives you access to the latest product as it drops so you don't have to wait in crazy queues with all the sneakerheads that are sure to be lined up from midnight waiting for the latest Jordans. You can even customise your pair of sneakers with the smallest of details and colour combinations.Most people can agree that when it comes to training one needs to make the time between work, kids, partners etcetera and this is where I was taken by this Nike+ app: you get to create a training plan that allows you to adjust as you go. This easy-to-navigate app is like having a personal coach in your pocket!Experiencing the app live at the Nike Innovation launch in New York was one of the most exhilarating experiences. As someone with little to no training, I pushed myself to heights I never thought I could reach, all because Nike promotes working out in groups.The hall-turned-gymnasium where we were training was filled with so much energy and cheering, with a hip-hop DJ bumping the best jams in the background, all while these good-looking trainers and world athletes were pushing us to reach our personal goals.I see the Nike+ app as an interactive vision board for my training.The aim of Nike is to make everything simpler, serving every athlete at their ability and level to reach their potential, any time, anywhere.All Nike apps, Nike+, Nike+ Run Club, Nike+ Training, and Nike+ SNKRS available on Android and Apple.
