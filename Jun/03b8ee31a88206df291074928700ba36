Following a two-day meeting at Lord's, the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) headquarters, the ICC cricket committee chaired by Kumble issued a statement saying it wanted MCC, which still has overall global responsibility for cricket's laws or rules, to instigate a clampdown.While there are limitations on bat length (when the lower portion of the handle is inserted, it shall not be more than 96.5cm) and width (10.8cm at its widest part), none currently exist on depth. The suits letting Proteas downModern manufacturers have become increasingly skilled at making bats with larger "sweet spots" that do not feel as heavy to pick up as the blades that were once only the preserve of 1980s power-hitters such as West Indies great Clive Lloyd and England hero Ian Botham.The balance between bat and ball has become especially loaded against bowlers in limited overs where the innovations brought in by Twenty20 cricket, allied to increasingly short boundaries, have led to an orgy of run scoring.Last year's 50-over World Cup in Australia and New Zealand witnessed 38 hundreds, nearly one every game, and 463 sixes, an average of one every nine overs.West Indies' Chris Gayle struck 16 sixes in racing to the fastest one-day international double hundred during a World Cup match against Zimbabwe at Canberra's Manuka Oval, while Martin Guptill of New Zealand hit a six measured at 110m in the course of his 237 against the West Indies in Wellington.This week's statement said: "MCC sought the committee's guidance on the desirability of making changes in order to redress the balance between bat and ball."The committee received a research paper from MCC citing a wealth of scientific and statistical evidence showing bats have become more powerful in recent years, primarily due to having larger 'sweet-spots'."
