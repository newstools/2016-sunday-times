The defect involves a possible gas leak in about 10000 De'Longhi SRI and IR3010 model heaters sold between 2013 and 2015.But although recall notices have been run in at least six national and regional newspapers - not once but three times - only 330 affected customers have been reached so far. Of those, 240 have taken advantage of the company's free repair offer.The leak - where the PVC hose joins the regulator - was discovered after analysis of a returned unit, prompting the recall early in January.The risk to consumers is fire, explosion and suffocation. No incidents, however, have been reported.The Chinese-made heaters were sold through independent retailers, chain stores and online retailers, mainly in South Africa. Just over 50 units were sold in Lesotho, Namibia and Botswana. But while retailers like Makro and Takealot keep records of customer details, others don't, so De'Longhi is hoping to reach the balance of customers through its ad campaign."We are constantly monitoring the response rate," said John Irving, MD of De'Longhi SA, this week. "It will determine further actions which need to be taken. Our intention is to reach as many end consumers as possible."He said customers were advised to stop using the heater and close it off at the gas bottle tap.Technicians would visit the homes of those affected in main centres to rectify the product, while in outlying areas the product would be collected, repaired and shipped back, Irving said.It's a good thing that winter, when most heaters will be hauled out again, is still some way off.Consumers can call 0860105556, e-mail gasheater@iccco.co.za or visit delonghi.com/en-za/ customer-care for details, including the serial numbers involved.
