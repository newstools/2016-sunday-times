As an early morning breakfast show chef, I'm fortunate that I live just seven minutes from work.I never eat before the show but afterwards I grab one of the fresh muffins baked daily for Expresso guests.My first cookbook is a true reflection of me, each recipe has a personal story attached.My first show on TV was cooking with children, which was tricky as I didn't know how they were going to react.</img> Image: Image: There are always disasters when cooking live on TV, we just learn how to hide them. Most memorable was a muffin recipe that completely flopped. We couldn't even pretend; it was a total mess.My love of food stems from watching my mom cook. She floats around so effortlessly in the kitchen and has always cooked the most delicious food. A favourite is steamed mealie bread. My dad orchestrates a mean braai too.My dad didn't flinch when I told him I wanted to be a chef, in fact, he encouraged me to pursue my passion.The professional kitchen is a tough place, you can't be timid or quiet otherwise the other chefs will walk all over you. It's possibly the reason I'm so loud-mouthed today.People think being a chef is like what you see on TV. In reality, it's hard work and long hours sweating behind a stove.Writing cookbooks versus television? They are both fulfilling. I love TV for the immediate gratification and I love writing cookbooks because it is long-lasting.My favourite cooking shows on TV are Rachel Khoo and Yotam Ottolenghi.Simply Delicious by Zola Nene (Struik Lifestyle) BEEF STEW WITH DUMPLINGS Dumplings, or amadombolo, were usually reserved for big family gatherings on my grandfather's farm, but occasionally Mom would surprise us with a hearty stew served with dumplings.Serves: 4-645ml cake flourSalt and freshly ground black pepper to taste500g stewing beef, cubed30ml (2 tbsp) olive oil2 onions, chopped5 new & exciting ways to cook chicken1 large carrot, peeled and chopped1 bay leaf4 sprigs fresh thyme250g button mushrooms, halved30ml (2 tbsp) tomato paste410g can chopped tomatoes500ml (2 cups) beef stockFor the dumplings:280g cake flour, sifted5ml (1 tsp) salt5ml (1 tsp) white sugar5g instant dry yeastAbout 375ml warm waterMethod:1) Season the flour with salt and pepper and use to coat the beef.2) Heat the oil in a large saucepan with a tight-fitting lid over high heat and brown the beef in batches. Set aside all the meat.3) To the same saucepan, add the onions, carrot, bay leaf, thyme and mushrooms.4) Saut until the vegetables begin to soften and brown.5) Add the tomato paste, tomatoes and stock and bring to a simmer. Return the beef to the pan, cover with the lid and gently simmer for 1 hour or until the meat is tender.6) In the meantime, make the dumplings by mixing the flour, salt, sugar and yeast in a bowl and adding enough warm water to form a soft and pliable dough.7) Knead the dough until elastic, cover the bowl with cling film and leave to rise for 30 minutes in a warm place. Pinch off small bits of dough, roll into balls and place onto the stew, which by now has been cooking for about 45 minutes.8) Replace the lid and simmer for a further 15 minutes or until the dumplings have cooked through.
