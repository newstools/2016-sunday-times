Their eighth win of the season saw them replace Arrows in 10th with a two-point advantage while Clinton Larsen's side were consigned to their 10th defeat. It was their third loss in six matches but their second league defeat in succession.Arrows' first half mirrored the grey clouds that hung low over the city yesterday. They were disjointed, listless and went about proceedings like an absent-minded holidaymaker.With the dog pit that is the middle of the Premier Soccer League table getting ever so sticky, a massive lapse of concentration was the last thing they needed. Instead, they gave Stuart Baxter's side several reasons to enjoy the long weekend in Durban, which they deserved.In playing two defensive midfielders in Dean Furman and Michael Morton, neutralising Quincy Ngcobo and Gladwin Shitolo was the simple plan and it was executed efficiently. The creative midfield position has not been filled by Serame Letsoaka and Clinton Larsen this season. Against a hard-running midfield laced with speed merchant wingers, they were going to have a long afternoon.The first 45 felt like a recurring nightmare with Thuso Phala and Luvolwethu Mpeta making hay even though the sun didn't shine.SuperSport's goals came from Dove Wome and Kingston Nkatha, whose intelligent running lines and positions were a source of constant worry for Arrows' sleepy defence.Wome latched onto a killer pass from Phala to slot a low shot past Max Mbaeva in the fourth minute while Nkatha converted a 29th minute penalty when Chris Katjiukua pulled down Clayton Daniels in the box.To say fortune dictated how SuperSport would go about their first half business would be doing a disservice in terms of how well they dissected the hosts.The two shots from Kudakwashe Mahachi and Ngcobo in the 38th and 45th minutes did not warrant the term "chances" but that was the closest they would come to making Ronwen Williams stretch an extra muscle. When Siyabonga Dube was sent off in the 72nd minute for a second bookable offence, it was the raising of the white flag.Arrows continued their insipid ways in the second half and when Jeremy Brockie scored in the 87th, their sorry afternoon was summed up in that calamitous moment.
