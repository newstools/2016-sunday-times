Before you imagine any miscreant activity, it's the sound of a breast pump. It may emanate from a quiet space (like a server room) with aircon, a plug point and privacy.At our offices, it's an obscure room on the third floor. Inside is a stretcher-bed with two blue pillows, a wheelchair and an empty medicine cabinet, basking in fluorescent light. The "san room". The green and cream lino tiles belie the magic that happens here. It must be magic. It better be. Because it isn't a breeze to be semi-naked while colleagues are bashing keyboards below you. You worry someone will barge in, triggering milky disaster.It makes one identify with the cows of this world, who've been doing this, in public, for aeons, for all our sakes. It's a messy science, milk production. Taxing on the body and easily derailed by fatigue, stress, diet, moods. Remember that next time you splash some in a cuppa.7 smart strategies to make breastfeeding work at workTo make milk is one thing. To express, transport and store it? We deserve awards. The fat rolls on our babies' thighs are ample reward, but medals or sugar wouldn't hurt.For some it comes easy, literally. They read biographies to pass the time and have litres to spare. For others, it means sitting through cold winter nights, begging distorted nipples to get on with it, with little result - and no spare hand to turn pages. A nose is not a precise digit.Yet we persist, and pump. Staring at the ceiling of the unsanitary san, in an iffy chair. And then hoping to remember to button up. The cooler bag goes in the fridge next to someone's soba noodles, as you side-eye the egg that nobody has removed for three weeks.Then straight home in freezing aircon, driving gingerly because you are carrying a little lactose bomb.Hats off to all those mums who bare - and bear - all at the office. You've earned those fat rolls. And chocolate. Dairy-free, please.
