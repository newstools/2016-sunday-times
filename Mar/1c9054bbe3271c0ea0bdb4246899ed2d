A degree of intrigue now surrounds a meeting this week of the Premier League's big five clubs at a prestigious hotel in London.According to The Sun, which broke the story, Manchester United, Manchester City, Liverpool, Arsenal and Chelsea were there to resurrect an idea we have seen mooted in the past - a European super league. Spurs let 10-man Gunners off the hook in thrillerThis time the talks were with US billionaire Stephen Ross.It would be a new, invite-only event that would see the biggest English clubs partner with their continental counterparts.Such a move would mean the end of the Champions League and pose a threat to both the Premier League and Uefa, which governs European football.But Uefa said it was ready to fight any attempt by England's big five to start a European Super League or radically revamp the Champions League.Uefa responded to the news by declaring the format of its club competitions was under constant review, something that could lead to amendments ahead of the sale of its TV rights for the 2018-21 seasons later this year.But it is understood it will resist the Super League creation - which would require its approval to be ratified by Fifa - or any moves to guarantee clubs Champions League places.West Ham United co-chairman David Sullivan told The Daily Telegraph such proposals "would destroy football as we know it. It's so sad that five clubs all owned by foreigners are even considering it."Similar to the outcry that accompanied the Premier League's aborted plans for a "39th game", the story sparked an inevitable backlash from those who view such an idea as elitist nonsense, motivated by greedy clubs about to benefit from a record 8-billion TV deal and already under pressure over the cost of tickets.It has also been noted that the so-called big clubs present at the summit currently lie third (Arsenal), fourth (Manchester City), fifth (Manchester United), eighth (Chelsea) and 11th (Liverpool) in the table.Premier League leaders Leicester City and closest rivals Tottenham Hotspur do not seem to have been invited.Ross himself was not present during the talks held with executives from his company Relevant, which organises lucrative summer tours and pre-season tournaments - under the guise of the International Champions Cup - for Premier League clubs in the US, China and Australia.Given how much business Ross has done with these clubs, the meeting shouldn't therefore come as that big a surprise - and those present did discuss future tours and fixtures. They also insist a breakaway from the Premier League is not on the agenda. However, the talks did focus on possible reform of the Champions League, something that is on the agenda within European football's corridors of power. A number of forces are driving this.Last week Barcelona president Josep Bartomeu said he was in favour of tennis-style "wild cards", guaranteeing automatic entry to the Champions League for big clubs that miss out on qualification via their domestic leagues.Many fans despise the idea, believing it devalues the Champions League and means unnecessary meddling with the meritocracy, integrity and excitement of domestic competition, as well as adding up to unfair protectionism for the richest clubs, but it is easy to see why this more pragmatic approach, offering greater certainty, would appeal to some.This year, for example, the likes of United, Liverpool and Chelsea all seem likely to miss out on the Champions League riches, as clubs like Leicester threaten an elite that, since 1992, has enjoyed routine entry to Europe's premier competition.A memorandum of understanding between the European Club Association and Uefa, lasting until 2022, was signed last year - but there is a sense the current formats need improving, with the group stages of the Champions League and Europa League seen as predictable and dull.bbc.com
