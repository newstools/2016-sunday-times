Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) are keen to make a marquee, world-class signing should they decide against renewing Ibrahimovic's contract, which expires at the end of this season, and over which a final decision could be made within weeks.The French club's No1 target remains Ronaldo - and talks have been held - with Hazard's representatives hopeful that Real Madrid will move for the Chelsea player if Ronaldo does leave. That remains in the balance, however. Alternatively, PSG may make a fresh inquiry for Hazard although they are aware that the Belgian, who they have tried to sign since he played for Lille, would prefer not to return to the French league.Whatever happens, PSG do not want to leave themselves without a big star with global appeal - and are also monitoring whether Gareth Bale also wants to stay at Real - and acknowledge that Ibrahimovic, despite being 34, has been in outstanding form this year after a less impressive previous campaign.The Swede scored two goals and was involved in creating the other two as PSG eliminated Chelsea 4-2 on aggregate to reach the last eight of the Champions League.Though Ibrahimovic has flirted with the idea of moving to the Premier League - and is understood to have privately identified Arsenal as a club he would consider joining - it is understood the lanky striker would prefer to sign a new deal with PSG.His family is settled and happy in Paris and Ibrahimovic also, despite his boasts that he is playing better than ever, is aware he is growing older and may find it harder to dominate another league. A return to Spain or Italy is highly unlikely as is a move to Germany.At the same time, Ibrahimovic is not sure he wants to join, yet, a Major League Soccer club in the US and would prefer at least one more year at a leading European club.The most likely scenario remains that he will therefore sign a new 12-month contract at PSG although if they can attract a player of the scale of Ronaldo, Hazard, Bale or even Neymar they would probably have to let Ibrahimovic go to cover his wages. Either way, PSG are determined they will have a world superstar in their squad, one who will be the biggest name in French football and help build the ambitious club's profile.Initial encouragement that Ronaldo could move to PSG has lessened though it is believed the Portuguese's future is in the balance. He has similarly flirted with former club Manchester United and though they would still be interested in taking him back, the club believes the star player needs to make the running on a deal this time round.Hazard is greatly admired by Real coach Zinedine Zidane and craves a move to the Spanish giants despite a disappointing season, after last season's heights.Chelsea do not want to sell the 25-year-old who renewed his contract last year also.As Ibrahimovic stated in the pre-match press conference on Wednesday at Stamford Bridge, PSG owners Qatari Sports Investments will "hunt down" the Champions League until they win it. PSG could retain the French title as early as next week and are in contention for both domestic cup competitions but the priority is to reach the Champions League semifinals having exited at the last eight in the previous three seasons.
