For those too young to remember, SA have indeed enjoyed limited-overs glory in the past. Not once, but twice.In a magical two-month spell in 1998, SA won the Commonwealth Games in Malaysia and then the ICC Knockout Trophy in Bangladesh.That second competition, later renamed the Champions Trophy, was eventually guillotined, although it's due to be resurrected from next year.And no Commonwealth Games host has staged cricket since (the Games matches did not enjoy ODI status, but the Australian team SA beat in the final was a dinkum national outfit).The World T20 would surely survive a Proteas win, but sadly it's not written in the stars.The Big Debate: Sbu Mjikeliso thinks Proteas can pull it off Oh, yes, the Proteas have the quality players to emerge victorious in this sixth edition of the WT20 in India. But we've seen this movie before, and we know how it ends. Every soul-ripping time.I find that lowering one's expectations is a good psychological buffer that always comes in handy.SA have a favourable draw, facing Sri Lanka, West Indies and En gland in their group alongside a yet-to-be-decided side from the second tier.In all WT20 matches played to date, SA have a record of 16 wins and 10 defeats.The good news is that in previous WT20 encounters, SA lead England 3-1, the Windies 2-0 and are 1-1 with Sri Lanka.Finishing as one of the top two teams appears a formality, and if harbouring such a thought doesn't condemn them to an early exit, the statistics of past WT20s will ensure disaster later down the road.The Proteas have never won a knockout match in a WT20 competition (it took them 23 years to register their first knockout victory at a World Cup!).New Zealand, India, Australia and Pakistan wait for them as potential semifinal opponents.The Kiwis might be the Proteas' World Cup hoodoo team, but it's a different story at WT20 - SA lead them 4-0. So far, that is.The Proteas, however, trail the other three sides - 0-3 to Pakistan, 1-3 to India and 0-1 to Australia.SA, like New Zealand, have won six of their last nine completed T20 matches, while India have won eight from nine and the Aussies just four.Some argue that this format is a lottery (if so: when last did you hit the jackpot?), but good form is required.SA have yet to find that match-winning rhythm, and maybe they will.But history says otherwise.Once more unto the breach, my poor, doomed compatriots.
