Holders Arsenal, bidding to become the first club since Blackburn Rovers in 1886 to win the FA Cup three years in succession, are at home to Premier League rivals Watford in today's other standout fixture.But it is Van Gaal who, again, has the attention of fans and pundits alike.Every weekend has been a big weekend for Van Gaal but, let's be honest, it almost doesn't matter anymore.The Europa League defeat at Liverpool on Thursday coming on the back of the loss at West Bromwich Albion took United back to the dark days of December, when Van Gaal really should have been sacked. Despite all the conflicting noises and agendas within the club, it seems clear the Dutchman will go in the summer.He knows it, the players know it, and it shows in their performances.Regardless of their shambolic Premier League and European form, though, United are two wins from the FA Cup final.Unfortunately, in today's quarterfinal, they come up against the only in-form side left in the competition.West Ham have already held United at Old Trafford this season and given their form ahead of the clash between the league's fifth and sixth-placed sides, you would not lump the mortgage on United making the last four.Unless you were Degs. Lukaku double puts Toffees at WembleyVan Gaal has spoken of his personal desire to win the FA Cup to add to domestic cup wins with Ajax Amsterdam, Barcelona and Bayern Munich.The manager admitted that the Europa League was the priority for the club given the carrot of a Champions League place but the FA Cup may as well now take priority. It's been 12 years since United won the trophy.Who'll stop Arsenal?Meanwhile, Arsene Wenger's charges, after convincingly seeing off Hull City at the second attempt, have immediately been made favourites to lift the FA Cup for the third season in succession when they host Watford today.Foxes: one foot in itLeicester City will tomorrow continue their chase for a first top-flight title in the club's 132-year history when they host second-bottom Newcastle United, who sacked their manager Steve McClaren on Friday.The experience of being part of a relegation battle has proven invaluable for Leicester as it has helped them cope with the pressure of being at the other end of the Premier League, influential winger Riyad Mahrez has said.Under former manager Nigel Pearson, Leicester survived a fight against the drop last season by winning seven of their last nine matches to finish 14th.In a remarkable reversal of fortunes, Claudio Ranieri's side are currently top, five points ahead of Tottenham Hotspur with nine games remaining."No pressure. We are playing as always. We just work hard for everyone. We are just a good team, good teammates and we are doing well. We have to keep going," Mahrez told the media.Meanwhile, manager Ranieri has urged the club to reward head of recruitment Steve Walsh, who brought Mahrez to the King Power Stadium, and assistant manager Craig Shakespeare with new contracts to help the Foxes build on this season's success.- AFP, football365.com and the Daily Telegraph, London
