United are to face neighbours Manchester City in a derby in Beijing on July 25 during their summer tour in which they will also face Borussia Dortmund.The video to promote the eight-day Chinese visit features legendary United players, such as George Best and Eric Cantona, as well as glimpses of no fewer than 14 of the current United first-team squad - including newcomers Marcus Rashford and Guillermo Varela. There are even fleeting shots of assistant manager Ryan Giggs.But nowhere in the near-minute-long package is there any footage showing the 64-year-old Dutchman. The situation is in stark contrast to last season when United leaned heavily on their famous manager in promotional material.The fact that Van Gaal has been airbrushed from the marketing campaign will simply fuel speculation that he will be leaving the club this summer, two-thirds of the way into the three-year contract he signed when he took over from David Moyes and which, he claimed, will mark his last job in football.United have steadfastly refused to respond to conjecture about Van Gaal's future or indeed the many reports that Jos Mourinho has already agreed to take over this June. No United spokesman was available to comment on the video.However, the prospect of City and United both unveiling new managers in a glamour friendly in the Far East is moving ever closer, with Beijing's Bird's Nest stadium now seeming likely to host a first English meeting between City's new manager Pep Guardiola and Mourinho.The latest development comes, ironically, just days after Van Gaal recorded, arguably, his best result in two frustrating years at the club, a 1-0 derby win at the Etihad Stadium which hauled United to within a point of fourth place and a spot in next season's Champions League.United's squad is likely to undergo great upheaval during the summer, but star midfielder Juan Mata insists he would welcome Zlatan Ibrahimovic if the controversial Paris Saint-Germain striker were to move to Old Trafford next season .
