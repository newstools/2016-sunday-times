The Windies successfully chased down a target of 123 with just two balls to spare for a third consecutive Group One victory, becoming the second team to qualify for the last four after New Zealand."We came here to win this match and qualify, and we've done that, so we're really happy," Sammy said after his side's victory at Nagpur's Vidarbha Cricket Association Stadium.The skipper admitted he was feeling "butterflies" as the Windies made hard work of it towards the end, going into the last over requiring nine runs to win."We were under pressure chasing a low total, and every decision we took out there they responded. But I really want to commend my team," said Sammy.It was South Africa's second defeat of the tournament and means England can secure a berth in the semis at their expense with a win against Sri Lanka on Saturday.Proteas captain Faf du Plessis rued his side's poor total of 122 for eight after Sammy won the toss and elected to field first."It felt like the whole game we were half a step behind West Indies and we were trying to catch up the whole time," Du Plessis said.The Windies rode on a gritty 44 from Marlon Samuels to prevail in a close finish.It looked like the Windies would canter home but Imran Tahir grabbed two wickets in the 17th over and the Caribbean side ended up going into the final over with a lot to do.Carlos Brathwaite hit a massive six before precocious fast bowler Kagiso Rabada bowled a wide. Brathwaite then grabbed a quick run before Denesh Ramdin carried the Windies over the line with a single.Samuels' 32-run partnership for the third wicket with Johnson Charles (32) set up the chase only for the team to lose their way in the middle overs.Andre Fletcher made 11 while Chris Gayle surprisingly shone with the ball rather than the bat.The big-hitting left hander smashed a four off his first ball but was clean bowled by Rabada off his second.Gayle had earlier claimed two wickets as South Africa suffered from lack of partnerships in a crucial game for their survival in the tournament.Left-hander Quinton de Kock top-scored for the Proteas with 47 while David Wiese, batting at number seven, notched 28.Hashim Amla was run out for one on just the third ball of the innings.Captain Faf du Plessis came in and didn't last long, scoring nine off seven balls before being caught by Sulieman Benn off paceman Andre Russell.It quickly got worse for the Proteas when Gayle, who has barely turned his arm over in recent years, grabbed the wicket of Rilee Rossouw.Rossouw's dismissal, which the dreadlocked Gayle celebrated with a little jig, left South Africa reeling on 20 for three after three overs.South Africa needed AB de Villiers to put a big score on the board but the classy stroke-player could only manage 10 before being cleaned up by Dwayne Bravo.David Miller then came in but lasted only four balls, bowled by Gayle.With just one win from two games, South Africa face the prospect of being dumped out before they've completed all their group-stage matches and their future in the tournament is now out of their hands.If England defeat Sri Lanka in New Delhi then South Africa's clash against the islanders on Monday becomes a 'dead rubber' and the Proteas' long wait for a first international trophy will continue.
