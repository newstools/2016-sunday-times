"I'm not interested in five-day cricket, it's too long," said Loday outside Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium."T20's more entertaining. We like seeing sixes and fours."The success of the ongoing World Twenty20 should be cause for celebration for administrators, with millions of TV viewers and packed houses enjoying batting pyrotechnics from the likes of Chris Gayle and AB de Villiers.But while Twenty20 cricket was conceived as a way for cash-strapped boards to make some money on the side, its growth in the last decade has led to fears it might devour the longest form of the game. Cricket fans fall in love with daring AfghansThe official line is that Twenty20 can spread the game and encourage newcomers to the five-day test matches, or 50-over one-day internationals."We want to make sure all three formats of the game - test, one-dayers and Twenty20 - are going to be able to co-exist well into the future and not only survive but flourish," said International Cricket Council (ICC) chief executive David Richardson.But with the proliferation of domestic Twenty20 tournaments giving players the chance to earn more in six weeks than they get from their boards in a year, some stars are turning their back on tests.And with tests often attracting paltry crowds, some players worry Twenty20 cricket is endangering the format it was meant to underwrite."I think it does threaten the traditional game," said England skipper Eoin Morgan, before admitting he didn't have any solution to the problem.This year's World Twenty20 in India is the third on the subcontinent in a little over three years. In contrast, the one-day international World Cup is every four years.Players such as Gayle of the West Indies have stopped playing tests and instead earn big bucks in tournaments such as Australia's Big Bash or the Bangladesh Premier League.Gayle has admitted he would "not be so sad" if test cricket died a death, while De Villiers - South Africa's test captain and still only 32 years - recently acknowledged rumours he was thinking of quitting international cricket in favour of Twenty20 tournaments. It's do-or-die for India"There are big tournaments going on around the world and some of them you can't ignore because financially they make a huge difference in our lives," he said.The biggest is the Indian Premier League (IPL) where an evening's fun features cheerleaders, fireworks and cameos by Bollywood stars.Indian legend Kapil Dev said there was no point trying to hold back the tide and "the T20 format is the future"."There is no doubt that test cricket is far superior - but then the public, young and old, are hooked on to this format. It does not matter whether I like it or not!" he wrote in India's Mail Today newspaper.Richardson said the ICC was trying to devise a calendar that didn't force players to choose between their country and a Twenty20 money-spinner, acknowledging the need for a balance to ensure "they don't cannibalise each other".
