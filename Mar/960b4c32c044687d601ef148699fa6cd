If that happens it would be a step closer to the creation of a European Super League with the bigger clubs effectively guaranteed more matches - there would be 14 in the group stages because they would play each other home and away.Many of Europe's biggest clubs - especially from Germany, Italy and Spain - are lobbying Uefa to change the format partly because they believe it has fallen behind the Premier League, certainly when it comes to revenue, and they argue there are too many uninteresting games in the group stages.Several proposals are under discussion and a change is expected to be announced before the start of next season, though it will not take effect until 2018 as the competition works in three-year cycles. Who's this man behind Spurs?Creating two leagues of eight would mean abolishing the round of 16 which, it is widely accepted, is too spread out. Instead, there would be at least one more knock-out round before the group stages to weed out weaker teams and reduce the number left earlier without the big clubs losing out. The group matches would inevitably have to continue beyond Christmas - they currently end in December - to fit in the extra games for the 16 teams.The bigger clubs argue there are currently too many ties that are hard to sell in the group stages.The idea would be to extend the qualifying rounds to reduce the clubs who make it through to the group stages from 32 to 16.The danger in this would be that some big clubs may not make it through - though they might propose the right to automatic entry.Terror threat to Euro 2016 ChampionshipsThis week's terror attacks in Brussels have raised the possibility that this summer's European Football Championships in France could be played behind closed doors.According to the Daily Mirror that is "the shock warning" from Uefa in the wake of the twin attacks on Belgium that left more than 30 people dead and hundreds injured.The attacks are another stark reminder of the threat posed by Islamic State to Europe.Speaking to a French radio station hours after the attacks in Brussels, Uefa executive committee vice-president Giancarlo Abete reiterated the organisation's determination to press ahead with the tournament in France. "Euro 2016 is the kind of event we can't delay or postpone," he explained, before warning: "We can't exclude the possibility of playing behind closed doors as we cannot exclude terrorism." Uefa issued a statement on Tuesday in which it sought to downplay fears that Euro 16 would be a tournament without fans, insisting that "safety and security" were at the centre of its plans for Euro 2016.France's Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve issued a message along similar lines, declaring that: "It is 80 days to the start of Euro 2016 and the organisers, cities and state services are fully mobilised... Euro 2016 must combine sportsmanship, festivity and security for the teams, coaches and fans."Nonetheless, The Sun claims that despite the reassurances from the French government a "ring of steel" will be erected around the tournament, particularly the 24 teams travelling to France.The paper says France has already "invoked a previously unused part of the EU's Lisbon Treaty to call on the help of British special forces throughout the entire tournament".Security personnel from Interpol will also be present at team hotels, training camps and match stadiums to counter any possible attack from Islamic State.Of particular concern to authorities is the match between England and Wales on June 16, which will be in the northern French city of Lens, just 45 minutes from the Belgian border. According to the Sun, security chiefs from Uefa and the FA "have met in London and there have been various meetings with the UK Foreign Office as they attempt to formalise plans for this summer's tournament".The Daily Telegraph, London and theweek.co.uk
