Aussie Aussie Aussie, Oi Oi OiAmazing as it may seem, but Australia could have scored more than 434. Their innings contained 109 dot balls with Simon Katich's knock (79 off 90 balls) proving pedestrian in the context of the game. Although Michael Hussey (81 off 51) hurried things along with Ricky Ponting (164 off 105), Katich's occupation of the crease robbed Andrew Symonds of the opportunity to take full toll.In the end, the destructive Symonds faced just 13 balls in compiling 27 for a strike rate of 207, the highest of any batsman on the day. Little Tasmanian DevilIt had been suggested in the months leading up to the match that Ponting's bat had contained graphite and that assertion grew firmer as the captain made the ball disappear to and over the boundary with monotonous regularity.He missed the first two games of the series but he proved the lynchpin of the Australian innings as he delivered a 105-ball master class.Taking the MickeySurrounded by an outfield as smooth as a billiards table, the pitch was as predictable as the N1 between Laingsburg and Beaufort West. There was no place to hide for the luckless Mick Lewis.Despite the fact that all measure of batting records have since tumbled, Lewis' deeply undesirable 10 overs for 113 has stood the test of time as the most runs conceded by a bowler in one-day match history.Piping hot Herschelle The Graeme Smith/Herschelle Gibbs 187-run second wicket partnership imbued South Africans, most notably those in the dressing room, with the belief that the mammoth total was reachable. After the early loss of Boeta Dippenaar, who faced all of seven balls for his single, the chase was on.By the time Smith (90 off 55 balls) dragged his exhausted body up the steps towards the dressing room, the Proteas were well on their way. Gibbs' average against Australia was only 22.25 before that innings but he set the record straight with an innings of artistic brutality.His 175 came off just 111 balls.Day of DisbeliefThe Wanderers crowd basked in the afterglow of this stunning victory but many were dazed by what they had just witnessed. They and much of the cricket world were trying to make sense of a day in which the sway bat held over ball was at its greatest.When during the break between innings some of the cast and crew of Tsotsi paraded their Oscar around the ground, it provided a welcome distraction from the carnage that had gone before. Little did the locals know they were going to be thrilled as Makhaya Ntini and then Mark Boucher brought an intense climax to a day in its entirety fit for a highlights package.
