By the end, though, it was death by a thousand cuts for Manchester United, and as Liverpool's supporters revelled in their conquest, the abiding sense was that only one of these local rivals is preparing a team to create anything resembling the famous acts of years gone by.Like many aspects of United's present-day operation, this became an inadequate imitation of evenings when, no matter how long the odds, they would chisel their way back into ties through sheer force of will.The difference in demeanour between the managers in their post-match conferences convincingly outlined their respective rates of progress."The movement, the timing, a lot of things are better," said Jurgen Klopp of an upturn in form. Manchester is all pepped up ahead of derbyKlopp has always been candid about his side's shortcomings and was critical here of their inability to capitalise on innumerable opportunities after half time.It was all the more perplexing to hear Louis van Gaal suggest that United had "played like Liverpool did in their home match". True, their first-half showing was a profound improvement; Van Gaal's team snapped and snarled at their opponents, out-pressing them and working the ball wide with speed and accuracy.United's desire and hunger were not open to question - it is just that so much else was.By the time Philippe Coutinho, dancing past a hopelessly callow Guillermo Varela before beating David de Gea in style, had settled things, the United goalkeeper had already made a stunning and low one-handed save from the same player.Daniel Sturridge had hit the crossbar from a free kick and Jordan Henderson, despite being second best in midfield, had scooped a clear chance over inside the penalty area.United had no such opportunities at Anfield and, while it was natural that Liverpool would find space on the counter, a little honesty would not have gone amiss. The lack of quality was palpable."We created wonderful chances, big chances, and De Gea had a wonderful night," said Klopp, who accepted that United had won too many 50-50 balls during the opening period. Klopp also outlined the difference it made to have a fit squad.Sturridge's fitness and form certainly make a difference and in both legs there was a fluidity and understanding among Liverpool's front four that, for all their intent, United were unable to match. Zidane's failed dream to play alongside GerrardVan Gaal, who saw Antonio Valencia return from four months out when he replaced Varela at the break, has long had recourse to an injury list. However, that does not explain the decision to leave Memphis Depay, for all his inconsistencies, on the bench when he was the sole attacker in reserve. There is a sense that every time United take a half-step forward this season they shoot themselves in the foot. While there was energy in abundance here, it is difficult to discern that much has actually changed since the start of the season.It has, for a club that has thrived upon going toe-to-toe with Europe's greats at Old Trafford in the Champions League, been an almighty fall.Liverpool cannot be classed in that bracket just yet, but the task in hand for Klopp now is to pull them closer to that level, and the quarterfinals bring a mouthwatering opportunity.The prospect - spectre, perhaps - of a reunion with Borussia Dortmund at some stage in the next two months will not go away, and it is Klopp's old side who, along with serial champions Sevilla, seem the most likely barriers between Liverpool and a Europa League title.- espn.co.uk
