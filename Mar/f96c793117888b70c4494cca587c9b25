Leaving Amla out to accommodate makeshift opener AB de Villiers shows how strong South Africa's batting lineup is.It matters little which side of the fence you fall on: whether, like Herschelle Gibbs, you think Faf Du Plessis is right in opening with De Villiers or you think it's too much tinkering too late. If you want Amla to be a Glenn Maxwell or a David Miller, sorry, you're knocking on the wrong door, bud.But, as he showed in the six-wicket defeat to Australia at Newlands, he is the quintessential modern cricketer - a chameleon across all three formats. And he loves creating magic in India.If you scroll further down the order you'll find another prolific batsman in this format, the captain.Surprisingly, Du Plessis appears at home in T20s. The skipper holds the highest T20 score for SA (119) and is one of only three South Africans to score a T20 international century.There are prot g s at either end of the Proteas lineup; Quinton de Kock and Kagiso Rabada. Both are relatively unscarred by South Africa's history of failure at world competitions. Neither has been part of a calamitous and familiar choke.De Kock's confidence is back. He's unafraid to take on the big names in world cricket and will be a big player at the top of the order.The sight of Rabada's death bowling is enough to give one collywobbles - especially for the batsmen who have to contend with his timely yorkers. In him the Proteas have a born winner.This tournament has come soon enough for the guys that stumbled against New Zealand in the semifinals of last year's 50-over World Cup who want to right that terrible wrong. Bar Morne Morkel and Vernon Philander, the T20 World Cup squad looks a lot like the one that became the first South African team to win a World Cup knockout game.The experience of winning a crunch game coupled with the burn of the agonising defeat to the co-hosts will light fire (excuse the pun) in Dale Steyn, JP Duminy and De Villiers.They'll remember how, when catches presented themselves in that semifinal, they crashed into each other instead like cartoon coyotes chasing a roadrunner.The series defeat to Australia at home, where the Proteas' fielding and defending totals left a lot to be desired, was a timely reminder not to get overconfident.
