Jos Buttler smashed 66 in a 37-ball knock as England made a commanding 171/4 that ultimately proved too much for Sri Lanka despite a brave, undefeated innings of 73 by injured skipper Angelo Mathews.England are now likely to face New Zealand in a semifinal match in Delhi after the Black Caps cruised to a 75-run win over Bangladesh in Kolkata to maintain their perfect record.Buttler, who hit eight fours and two sixes, shared in a fourth-wicket partnership of 74 with skipper Eoin Morgan (22) as Sri Lanka's bowlers battled to contain a late England onslaught at the Feroz Shah Kotla. This is no place to breed genuine allroundersBut after having Sri Lanka on the ropes at 15/4, they were then made to sweat, with Mathews hammering England's spin bowlers to all corners despite battling with a leg injury.He hit five sixes and three boundaries in a 54-ball innings.Mathews received crucial support from Chamara Kapugedera who hit 30, while Thisara Perera (20) and Dasun Shanaka (15 off nine balls) took the contest down to the wire.Moeen Ali and Adil Rashid were on the receiving end of some fierce hitting from the Sri Lankans, with both men conceding 21 in a single over.But Joe Root's stunning catch at mid-off to dismiss Shanaka off the bowling of Chris Jordan in the 19th over proved crucial as Mathews then began to run out of partners.With Sri Lanka needing 15 from the last six balls, allrounder Ben Stokes conceded just four runs to clinch victory."It turned out to be a fantastic game," said Buttler after being named man of the match, praising Stokes for bowling "that fantastic over at the death".England's innings got off to a poor start when Alex Hales, back after a back injury, was given out lbw off the bowling of the veteran Rangana Herath with only four on the board.But powerful hitting from Roy, who made 42 off 39, and Root (25) began to turn the match in England's favour before Buttler then stepped on the accelerator.Rookie spinner Jeffrey Vandersay was the pick of the Sri Lankan bowlers, taking 2/26 in an economical four-over spell in which he took the wickets of both Jason Roy and Root. SA wide of the markProvided the West Indies - who are also in the semis - do not lose to Afghanistan in their final group match, England next face a New Zealand team which surged through the groups with four wins out of four.Their latest win was the most clinical yet as they bowled out Bangladesh for just 70, their lowest total in Twenty20 cricket.Grant Elliott took 3/12 in his four overs, while Ish Sodhi chipped in with 3/21. New Zealand had earlier made 145/8 at Eden Gardens with Mustafizur Rahman taking 5/22.Skipper Kane Williamson top-scored with 42, an innings whose value was underlined when the New Zealand bowlers wreaked havoc."We certainly know that every game's tough and the fickle nature of T20 cricket - sometimes it's hard to work out," said Williamson.The remaining semifinal berth will be decided late today when the hosts take on Australia in Mohali.The final is to take place in Kolkata on Sunday.
