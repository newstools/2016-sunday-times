The fact that they have lost both Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara is bad enough, but with Lasith Malinga, Tillakaratne Dilshan and Rangana Herath on their last legs, it seemed Sri Lanka had almost no chance to defend their title, according to cricketcountry.comThe website goes on to say that Afghanistan would have gone into their opening match against Sri Lanka quietly confident of pulling off a victory. That Sri Lanka managed to overcome the spirited Afghan threat is largely down to the fact that Dilshan finally found some form. Protea Fire lights up the turnstilesEven with Dilshan in form and the likes of Angelo Mathews and Dinesh Chandimal in the lineup, Sri Lanka's batting order is unlikely to give anyone sleepless nights.However, it is their bowling that leaves even less of a mark, the website reports.Barring Dushmantha Chameera, Sri Lanka do not have anyone in the lineup who can both take wickets and keep the runs down.If AB de Villiers is a magician with the bat, Malinga was the sorcerer with the ball. The pinpoint yorkers, the impossible-to-pick slower balls, and the skill to employ either at will made Malinga the ideal T20 bowler.Malinga is the leading wicket-taker in T20 cricket with 299 victims. He also has the most wickets in the IPL .Sadly, it looks like his cricketing days are at an end. His recurring injuries may prevent him from reaching the 300-wicket mark in T20s.- cricketcountry.com
