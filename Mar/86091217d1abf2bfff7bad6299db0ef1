ASEC striker Adama Bakayoko headed a 54th-minute goal for the Ivorian club that is likely to see Chiefs again eliminated from the competition before the group stages in this coming weekend's return leg.Embattled Amakhosi coach Steve Komphela - who has overseen a trophyless campaign in his first season - was the target of the fans' jeers.Chiefs went out at the same stage to Raja Casablanca of Morocco last year, and in the second round to AS Vita of the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2014.Both of those were insipid performances. Last night's was more of the same.Amakhosi pride themselves on being one of the biggest clubs in Africa, yet repeatedly, embarrassingly, shy from testing that boast against their strongest continental compatriots. Like lambs to the slaughter - Pirates suffocate CosmosLast night they had their chances - though far too few, and poorly dealt with when they did come their way - against an ASEC side far off the powerhouse that lost to Orlando Pirates in the 1995 Champions Cup final, and won the competition in 1998.ASEC were happy to soak up pressure and defend for the entire first 45 minutes. They caught Amakhosi napping at the start of the second, then closed shop again.Komphela fielded his full-strength lineup.Lorenzo Gordinho returned in defence for Morgan Gould from Wednesday night's 2-0 league defeat to Platinum Stars in Rustenburg. George Maluleka replaced William Twala in the frontline.ASEC rely on their youth system - perhaps the most famed academy in Africa - for success. The Abidjan giants have their peaks and troughs in periods of success, as generations come through, win things for the club, then are sold on to Europe.It has been some time since the club have brought through a batch of players who have troubled African competition. They last qualified for the group stages of the Champions League from 2005 to 2008, reaching the semifinals in 2006.They last won the Ivory Coast Premier League in 2010, though they did finish runners-up to AS Tanda last season by a point.This campaign they are wallowing in 10th place, and fired coach Jean Marie Assoumou just over a week ago. Caretaker Siaka Traore was in charge of just his second match.ASEC had clearly come to sit back, and try to park an aircraft carrier.Chiefs were unconvincing, attempting to profit from the territory and possession they were gifted as a consequence.Maluleka was passed down the right by Camaldine Abraw but could not beat goalkeeper Herve Koffi Kouakou from a tight angle. Then his low shot was parried by Kouakou falling to his left. Penalty miss mars good night for DownsChiefs looked to be strolling their way to a goalless procession of missed chances.But ASEC came to life from the change-rooms and caught an Amakhosi defence, who had lolled off to sleep, by surprise with Bakayoko's headed goal.Forward Yannick Zakri Krahire swung a free kick in at pace from the right of Chiefs' area and Bakayoko was allowed to run onto a free header which he buried easily past Itumeleng Khune.As ASEC went straight back into their shell, Amakhosi had their chances.Bernard Parker spooned a volley, which also took a deflection, wide of goal. From Siphiwe Tshabalala's corner, Parker's near-post header had Kouakou at full stretch.Tshabalala could not react quickly enough after receiving a touch on from Abraw in front of goal, and Kgotso Moleko's strong shot forced another good stop from Kouakou.
