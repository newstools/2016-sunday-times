Pirates claimed their fourth successive victory and are now up to sixth place in the Premier Soccer League standings. The victory was made all the easier by the sending off of Cosmos defender Cheslyn Jampies after just 13 minutes.It had been a dream week up until then for the left back, called up to the national team for the first time on Thursday, but a horror two-footed lunge earned him a straight red from referee Victor Gomes.By that time, Pirates were already ahead after Ayanda Gcaba had struck from a tight angle with a powerful shot.On the half-hour mark, Pirates added misery toSono and his charges when Sifiso Myeni rose to head home Luvoyo Memela's free kick to make it 2-0. Penalty miss mars good night for DownsThe third goal, from Mpho Makola nine minutes later, was a special effort, but again came courtesy of slack defending as four Cosmos markers backed off and allowed the midfielder to glide in on goal and then toe-poke a dipping ball home into the corner. It was the sort of stuff you might see at Barcelona.Then came the fourth goal in the 42nd minute as defender Edwin Gyimah was allowed to set off on a storming run all the way into the Cosmos area, slipping the ball to Soweto derby hero Tendai Ndoro, who tapped home from close range.Ndoro could have completed a hat-trick just after the hour mark with three good chances but they all went begging.He had an opportunity when Gyimah played a searching ball over the top of the Cosmos defence and he was one-on-one against goalkeeper Sherwyn Naicker, who watched gratefully as the Zimbabwean attacker snatched his shot wide. Then Ndoro missed another with a header and soon after had a chance in front of goal but a fine tackle by Cosmos captain Frederick Nsabiyumva denied him.Substitute Gift Motupa also had a simple chance in the final quarter-hour but missed as the first-half goal deluge dried up, although Pirates' dominance remained the same after the break and chances kept coming.In the last minute, Motupa showed composure after being set up by Ndoro for the fifth goal of the night to round off an emphatic win.The five goals conceded mean Cosmos fall behind the University of Pretoria on goal difference and drop into second-last position on the log table.
