Playboy Enterprises have reportedly engaged an investment bank to look into the sale of the entire company's assets, which could be worth $500-million (about R7.7-billion).The move follows the marketing in January of the Playboy Mansion, a 2.5ha property in Beverly Hills famous for parties thrown by Hugh Hefner, the magazine's founder, who owns about a third of the company.
