The midfielder was expected, based on form, to make the Bafana team to play Cameroon later this month but he was left out, much to the dismay of local football supporters.But, as expected, Dolly was in the starting lineup when the Brazilians hosted The Beasts from Niari at Lucas Moripe Stadium in Atteridgeville in the first leg of their first-round Caf Champions League clash.And the 23-year-old was once again one of the players to watch, but the win didn't come easy.From the first whistle, L opards defended in numbers, and, for a while, Dolly and company battled to break down the visitors' defence despite seeing much of the ball. The hosts came close to taking the lead in the 26th minute, but Teko Modise's left-footed strike from the edge of the area came back off the crossbar.On the stroke of half time, Dolly produced a moment of brilliance when he picked up a pass and made a quick turn to his strong left foot. Dolly then picked his spot from 30 yards out, curled the ball with some power, and goalkeeper Herve Lomboto was well beaten as Sundowns finished the first stanza strongly.The home side picked up from where they had left off, with striker Leonardo Castro doubling Sundowns' lead just a minute into the second half.The Colombian benefited from a back-flick by Khama Billiat and his left-footed strike from the edge of the box was too good for Lomboto.Lomboto's night went from bad to worse when he was given his marching orders for a foul on Billiat that led to a penalty in the 81st minute.Anthony Laffor was brought in for Modise and, for his first touch, the Liberian was given the responsibility to take the spot kick. It backfired.Laffor fluffed the opportunity when he shot straight at Tresor Elenga and the match ended 2-0.The return leg will be played this coming Saturday at the Dennis Sassou Nguesso Stadium in Dolisie, the Republic of Congo.
