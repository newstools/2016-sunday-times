A narrow win by India over Bangladesh, followed by Australia's 21-run triumph against Pakistan, has effectively reduced today's group encounter into a knockout, with the winner making it to the semifinals."We've got a massive game coming up against India. Whoever wins that goes through," said Australian paceman James Faulkner after Friday's win against Pakistan."It was on our shoulders to turn the ship around and start winning. We have won two in a row, now we need to win another three to win the World Cup," said the bowler, who had a five-wicket haul against Pakistan, the first Australian to do so in T20 cricket. Australia are the reigning 50-over world champions and the number one test side, but have failed to win the World Twenty20 in five attempts.If they do manage to win the trophy this time it would be a fitting tribute to allrounder Shane Watson, who is set to quit international cricket at the end of the tournament.Watson was part of Australia's World Cup triumphs in 2007 and 2015 and also starred during the team's winning campaigns in the Champions Trophy finals of 2006 and 2009. The Aussies have won two games in this Twenty20 edition while going down to New Zealand, who have already qualified for the semis with three wins from as many matches.India were also handed a thrashing by the Black Caps, who are top of Group 2 and clearly one of the better-looking sides in the tournament.The home side, who won the inaugural World Twenty20 in 2007, bounced back to defeat archrivals Pakistan before pulling off a nerve-wracking one-run win against Bangladesh.The Indians will be praying for a full game today because a washout would throw the hosts out of the tournament, since Australia have a better run rate.India's star batsman Virat Kohli admitted the players would have to raise their game against the Aussies and not be overwhelmed."I think the only thing we can do in this situation is to stay in the moment and not get carried away by the bigger picture," Kohli said yesterday at a pre-match press conference. We know that we have to put them under pressure straight up to try and give them less chance of clicking as a team "Sometimes we forget to do what we need to do on a particular delivery, which could be a game-changing event. This format requires you to be top of your focus, concentration for 120 balls, batting and in the field."Watson said playing India in a knockout match before thousands of home fans would be the "ultimate challenge" for his side ."It is the ultimate challenge to play India in any format here in India," said Watson, 34."If you can beat India on Indian soil in any format, it's an incredible achievement."I certainly know that from plenty of experience here, so it's just going to be a great challenge and we certainly are going to be up for it."From my personal perspective, to have the opportunity to be able to play in what could be my last game is, I suppose, as big a dream as you could imagine. "So it's going to be very exciting," said Watson, who has 46 wickets and 1444 runs from 57 Twenty20 internationals so far.Australia are the reigning 50-over world champions and the number one test side, but have failed to win the World T20 in five previous attempts.India, winners of the inaugural 2007 edition, are eyeing their second title on home soil, having won the 50-over World Cup in Mumbai in 2011.Although they have not been on top of their game in this tournament, they did manage to win against arch-rivals Pakistan and a plucky Bangladesh.Watson, however, said he felt India shouldn't be underestimated, especially in home conditions, and the key for his team would be to put the hosts under pressure right from the first ball. "One thing about India is they are such a dangerous side."They haven't clicked so far in this tournament. [But] they've got world- class players for all types of wickets. And with their world-class players, when they click they are really unbeatable," said Watson, who looked in ominous form against Pakistan on Friday, making 44 from 21 balls."We know that we have to put them under pressure straight up to try and give them less chance of clicking as a team."
