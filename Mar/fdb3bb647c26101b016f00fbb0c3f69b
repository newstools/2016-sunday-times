Gerrard was linked with a move to the Bernabeu throughout his career and revealed that Jos Mourinho tried to buy him during his spell at Los Blancos.And according to Real legend Zidane, who now manages the club, only Gerrard's loyalty to the Reds prevented a transfer."For a time he was the best midfield player in the world," Zidane told Shortlist. "I told Madrid I wanted to play alongside him, but he was loyal to Liverpool."That was lucky for them, because he was a pleasure to watch and the complete midfield player."The Frenchman made the admission while naming his greatest ever Premier League XI. Zidane opted for Peter Schmeichel, Gary Neville, Jaap Stam, Rio Ferdinand, Ashley Cole, Claude Makelele, Gerrard, Patrick Vieira, Paul Scholes, Thierry Henry and Cristiano Ronaldo.He also reserved special praise for former Manchester United midfielder Scholes."One of my favourite players from any era, he was a player who made the hardest things look so easy," the 43-year-old added.Meanwhile, Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp says his initial reaction to seeing young midfield player Allan Rodrigues de Souza in training was "oh my God".Liverpool signed Allan from Internacional last summer but have been unable to play the 19-year-old due to work permit issues, instead loaning him out to Finnish side SJK and then Belgian outfit Sint-Truidense, for whom he has been playing regularly.Klopp told Liverpool's official website: "When I came here, one or two months later Allan was here and I said "who is this? He is a player for us."I saw him in training and I thought "oh my God, what can we do to keep this boy here and bring him into the lineup?"Allan has received a call-up for a Brazil Under-20 training camp in Rio de Janeiro, and Klopp is crossing his fingers he will soon be able to include the youngster in a Liverpool squad.Klopp added: "There is no chance in this moment here because he can't get the permission to play here."We hope we can find a solution in the future because he will be a fixed part of the squad, for sure. Now he uses this time to improve and the next step to the Under-20 national team of Brazil is a great story."
