Zimbabwe national, Tendai Ndoro, scored a brilliant second-half brace to book Pirates place in the Round of 16. Orlando Pirates burst out of the blocks against Chiefs, dominating possession and creating a flurry of chances early on, but Brilliant Khuzwayo lived up to his name to keep his side on level terms.Ndoro showed great pace in the fourth minute with a break down the left wing before cutting inside and launching a fierce shot but was denied by Khuzwayo.Minutes later, Thabo Rakhale sent a shot just over the bar before Gift Motupa squandered the best chance of the half when he somehow conspired to miss the target from about two metres away from the goal.Chiefs managed to battle their way back into the match and had a couple of chances late in the second half.Siphiwe Tshabalala's curling wicked curling shot in the 40th minute was well saved by Brighton Mhlongo before Bernard Parker went inches wide moments later with a skillful volley from the edge of the area.The start of the second half was a lot more measured by both teams, which resulted in a distinct lack of goalmouth action as the Soweto rivals looked unwilling to risk overextending and getting caught on the break.Just when it seemed as if the match was heading towards a 0-0 draw and extra time, Mpho Makola played a nice through-ball for Ndoro, who turned brilliantly with his first touch before smashing the ball past Khuzwayo to put Pirates 1-0 in the 75th minute.The Buccaneers were buoyed by the goal and began to pour forward. They found their second just eight minutes later as Ndoro took a speculative long-range shot from the left wing and the ball slid under Khuzwayo who could, and should, have done more to stop the shot.Chiefs went close to pulling one back deep into injury time with Eric Mathoho heading a Tshbalala cross just wide, but it was too little, too late and Orlando Pirates claimed an emphatic 2-0 win to advance to the Nedbank Cup round of 16.Orlando Pirates (0) 2 (Ndoro 77' 84')Kaizer Chiefs (0) 0Orlando Pirates: Mhlongo; Nyauza (Jele 82'), Gyimah, Gcaba, Matlaba - Rakhale, Makola, Sarr, Memela (Qalinge 71') - Motupa (Myeni 63'') - Ndoro Kaizer Chiefs: Pieterse; Moleko, Gould, Mathoho, Masilela (Lebese 87') - Katsande - Maluleka (Twala 74'), Baloyi, Tshabalala - Parker, Abraw (Mthembu 85') Source: Sport24
