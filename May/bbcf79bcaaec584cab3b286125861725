Of the 476649 people who applied for asylum in Germany last year, 31902 came from Afghanistan alone, with a further 8472 from Pakistan, which has seen the German Cricket Federation (DCB) flooded with a simple question: "Where can I play?"The DCB's chief executive officer, Brian Mantle, says they have been swamped by enquiries through their website - www.cricket.de - to set up clubs across the country, supply equipment and point new arrivals to their local team.Mantle, based in the western city of Essen, runs the DCB with only a part-timer for assistance.When the Englishman took over in 2012, there were about 1500 cricketers in Germany in 70 teams. Now, there are 4000 registered cricketers in 205 teams and last week the DCB welcomed its 100th new club, from Bautzen near the Czech border.And the numbers keep growing."We've been getting up to five enquiries a day from groups wanting to set up new clubs," Mantle said.Cricket has helped Arifullah Jamal to adapt to life, having fled to Germany from Afghanistan as a teenager with his younger brother in late 2009 to seek asylum.After 14 hours in a container on a journey from Greece to Italy, he ended up in a youth hostel in west Germany with his brother, struggling to make friends and learn German."The people in the home didn't know about cricket, but eventually they asked around and that was when Brian [Mantle] came to us and we played cricket again," he told AFP.Jamal was delighted to be able to play his favourite sport in his adopted country.Before long, the fast bowler was playing for the Germany under-19 side at international tournaments."It really was a dream come true, I'd only seen cricket played like that on television, everything was so professional and I never thought I'd end up playing for Germany," he added.He says he wanted to set up a team for refugees with the goal of winning promotion to the national championships, cricket's Bundesliga."It means there is a support network, they find out where the best places are to learn German, where they can find work," he said. "Cricket has given me so much."
