That was a time of the uprising, when the townships were burning, when the youth defended themselves against an armed-to-the-teeth police force with a dustbin lid as shield and a brick as a weapon.A song burst out whenever the yellow vehicle came along:Shis'imellow yellow boWe Ma x6Shis'ivuth'umlilo boWe Ma x3There is a new mellow yellow in town. It does not spark fear, but Pitso Mosimane wants his Downs to be foot soldiers to be feared.It is the Yellow Nation, as the Mamelodi Sundowns supporters call themselves. Armed with sweet voices, the Yellow Nation is staging a song uprising against the vuvuzela and it is music to the ears.When they are in full voice, you can't help but admire the carnival atmosphere they create, especially at their Moripe and Loftus cauldrons.It is the Brazilian samba with an African touch. Forget the vuvuzela, singing is reclaiming its spot as the main source of cheering, as was the case before the horn became the new fad.And the Yellow Nation is fast filling the void left by the Siwelele, the Bloemfontein Celtic supporters who have deserted their club in droves thanks to their running battles with club management.The team is in a league of its own. So are the multitudes on the terraces. With a dominant domestic display, the Downs players have made the point that they are the undisputed kings of the PSL castle.That dominance has to be translated to the Confederation of African Football Confederations Cup, where Sundowns find themselves after dropping out of the Caf Champions League.Here's why: The heroics of Orlando Pirates in continental competitions in the last three years must not go to waste. By sailing to the 2013 Champions League and 2015 Confed Cup finals, the Sea Robbers ensured that South Africa was in the top 12 of the rankings.Given how poorly other local participants performed on the continent, the increased slots for SA teams are under threat. Sundowns faced Medeama SC in the first leg of the play-offs last night.A victory over two legs will see them reach the Confed Cup group stages and keep alive coach Mosimane's healthy obsession with doing well. Healthy because no coach worth his salt must be satisfied with home comforts when he has not proved himself against the best of his peers in the whole of Africa.Mosimane craves being the best. Should they reach the group stage and go all the way, Mosimane will give the Yellow Nation reason to compose more songs in praise of the end of the struggle against poor performance in African competition.Follow BBK on twitter @bbkunplugged99
