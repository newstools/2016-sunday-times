Kohli has been in the form of his life since the recent World Twenty20 where he was instrumental in taking India to the semifinals before the hosts' heartbreaking loss to the West Indies.The 27-year-old was named player of the tournament after scoring 273 runs in five matches at an average of 136.50, and he has again been in a class of his own in this edition of the IPL.Kohli has shattered the previous best aggregate in a season by scoring 919 runs, including four centuries and six fifties.He had a rare failure in Wednesday's final four eliminator when he was bowled for a duck, but AB de Villiers stepped up to the plate with an unbeaten 79 which just saw Bangalore over the line.But Hyderabad skipper David Warner, second in the scoring chart behind Kohli with 779 runs, sounded a warning of his own with his scintillating innings of 93 not out in Delhi on Friday night.After previous editions had been marred by fixing and corruption, this year's tournament has managed to avoid any major scandal.Neither of the finalists have ever won the tournament, which is now in its ninth year.
