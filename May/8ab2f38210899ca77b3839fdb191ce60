Downs have looked at 18 men to bolster the team that won their second league title under Pitso Mosimane with two matches to spare and they will not revert to their massive shopping spree of old.Mosimane only wants four players: two central midfielders, a centre back and a playmaker, and the champions have cast the net within and beyond the country's borders.The Sunday Times understands a Colombian holding midfielder will be the first catch to close the void left by Bongani Zungu, who departs for Portuguese side Vit ria Guimar es in the off-season. Zungu was stretchered off the pitch when he suffered a hairline fracture of the shin in the 42nd minute in the 3-2 victory at Maritzburg United in February. The injury informed Downs that they were threadbare in that department, hence the chase for the Colombian whose compatriot Leonardo Castro's presence at Chloorkop will assist with adjustment."We've obtained the DVDs of the player, are happy with what we've seen and are confident that he will be a perfect fit," confirmed a Chloorkop insider. "He is assured on the ball, has long legs and big strides. We are withholding his name for now because we don't want people trying funny tricks and going behind our backs."At some stage after Zungu's injury Downs pursued Argentine midfielder Alexis Sebastian Cabrera Coronas, but the advance was abandoned when he was deemed too expensive.The search for a playmaker is informed by fear that they may not be able to fend off strong and tempting offers for Khama Billiat.The Zimbabwean has been in scorching form for club and has sizzled for his country, scoring in victories against Malawi and Swaziland to propel the group L leaders to the verge of qualification for Afcon 2017. The Zim Warriors are looking to qualify for the first time since 2006. If he gets PSL Footballer of the Season, as widely tipped, his stock will rise further and Downs will find it hard to resist big money suitors.Although they've conceded the least number of goals (20), following in the footsteps of departed formidable former captain Alje Schut has been a hard act to follow. His absence robbed them of an aerial advantage which was a source of goals in offensive situations.It is a great tribute to Downs that they steamrolled to the title with relative ease.Though he fell short of a treble, Mosimane will look back at the season with satisfaction having bagged a league and Telkom Knockout double.He created a harmonious atmosphere in the team where individual glory was sacrificed at the altar of collective teamwork.Another Mosimane stroke of genius was to stop being married to Teko Modise. Don't get it twisted, he didn't quite serve him with divorce papers ala Mosiua Lekota to the ANC. But he was able to bench the player without any ructions and whenever The General was called into action he delivered. Mosimane has been a smooth operator on and off the field.On it, he has mastered the art of bouncebackability: whenever Downs stumbled (1-0 to Golden Arrows, 3-1 to Bloemfontein Celtic), they bounced back by visiting vengeance on the next opponents. Tales of bad blood between Mosimane and Liberian live-wire Antony Laffor were told during the course of the campaign.Rumblings of discontent with limited playing times afflicted Wayne Sandilands and Lebohang Mokoena, the latter taking to the media to voice his displeasure.The Mosimane of old would have responded with razor-sharp remarks of his own.But now he has matured into a mellow coach and dealt with discontent with the calm demeanour of a Buddhist.So much so that the title-clinching victory away to neighbours University of Pretoria came courtesy of a Laffor hat-trick.He has even refrained from picking fights with referees, restraining himself from ranting and raving about the whistlemen even when Downs found themselves on the receiving end of dubious decisions.bbk@sundaytimes.co.za
