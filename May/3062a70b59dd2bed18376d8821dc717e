HIM:Petite Noir loves a spritz of Tom Ford Noir, massages, and any kind of pampering. Everyone loves being pampered, he says.HER:Rharha s favourite products? She favours the natural variety: I use activated charcoal. I brush my teeth with it and use it to cleanse my face. She uses olive oil, too, to moisturise her glowing skin. EXPERTS SPILL THE BEAUTY BEANS LIPSLesley Whitby, makeup artist (using MAC) says: I used a lip liner called Night Moth from MAC to accentuate Rharha s lips for the shoot. And then a burgundy lipstick was used to get Rharha s hue. (Try MAC Matte lipstick in Diva).Petite Noir: The politics of Noirwave styleEYESLes enhanced Rharha s eyes by extending the length of liquid eyeliner onwards, flicking them up slightly at the corners. I also used some false lashes, says Les, to create added drama. Try a gel liner like Bobbi Brown s Long Wear Gel Eyeliner, R295. It comes in a tiny pot and is applied using a brush, which gives better grip and is easier to use than the felt-tip variety (Try Bobbi Brown Eye Definer brush, R350). Rharha has great, full brows, says Les, so she just needed a little bit of definition with a brow brush. Because, these days, we say eyebrows are everything. MAC Fluidline Liner, R215 also comes in a nifty pot and has loads of colour choices, like Waveline (a cobalt blue) or Macroviolet (a purple hue).SKINLes highlighted Rharha s skin, making it glow even more. She didn t use blusher, but contoured her cheeks to get definition and depth to her cheeks.HAIRHairstylist Saadique Ryklief says: Any kind of texturising and sculpting products work beautifully for Rharha s look. He separated Rharha s full curls using his fingers.
