The Ghanaian knows his robust display kept the PSL's little Neymar, Khama Billiat, wrapped up and out of the game, and was instrumental in what turned into a 2-0 extra-time win for Orlando Pirates."During the week I sat quietly, thinking how I was going to deal with Billiat. We had played Sundowns twice and he was able to get the run on us and score both times," Gyimah said this week."I watched his clips. Playing against such a striker your concentration level must be high. If you take your eyes off of him he will score." Gyimah meets a different sort of striker in Saturday's Nedbank final. SuperSport United's Jeremy Brockie has positional intelligence and is the PSL's best finisher. The Kiwi shoots from anywhere."Wherever the ball is in the , he always tries something. You don't give him space," Gyimah said.Pirates' midfielder-turned-centreback has brought energy and physical presence to Bucs' defence in the second half of the season. A back four of Ntsikelelo Nyauza, Gyimah, Ayanda Gcaba and Thabo Matlaba have provided a more dynamic combination from a defence that was becoming static with age.Gyimah was spotted playing for Ghana at the All Africa Games in Maputo and was signed by SuperSport in 2011.He believes Bucs' hardships this season, losing against Tunisians Etoile du Sahel after a gruelling run to November's Caf Confederation Cup final, then suffering the consequences in the PSL, gives them the hunger to edge his former side in the Nedbank final."I've played for SuperSport. I know the expectations they have at that club," he said."But we have had a bad run in the league. We had to settle for runners-up in the Confed. I think this Nedbank Cup, we seriously need it."
