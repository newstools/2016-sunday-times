A club he started in 2007 is now on the brink of winning promotion to the biggest league in the country and he's almost certain that his boys won't trip and fall as history beckons for this team from rural Ga-Mphahlele in Limpopo.It's been quite a journey for leaders Baroka, who have moved from amateur ranks to within 90 minutes of reaching top-flight football, after a fantastic season in the National First Division where they've dominated both at home and away this term.Kgoloko Thobejane, who was the technical director, stepped in as coach after Sello Chokoe left the club and he has been phenomenal in the job. Three points ahead of second-placed Highlands Park, Baroka face Milano United in their final game of the season at Peter Mokaba Stadium (3pm).Baroka need just a draw to win promotion."I want the boys to say goodbye to the NFD in style," said Mphahlele, who is planning to give his players bonuses when they win promotion to the Absa Premiership, although he didn't say how much players would receive."I spoke to the coach and I know the boys can do the job."Mphahlele dismissed as "jealousy" claims that player Tshepo Matete was improperly registered.Matete was taken out the 18-man match-day squad against African Warriors a fortnight ago to avoid any conflict, according to the club, and they are confident that this will not affect them."There was never a case. We are just looking forward to Sunday," said Baroka CEO Morgan Mammila.Baroka are planning for a big party in Polokwane and a farewell for their 17-goal striker Thabiso Kutumela, who is joining Orlando Pirates next season.Highlands Park have also been impressive this season, but have let themselves down on many occasions.They will have another shot in the play-offs.
