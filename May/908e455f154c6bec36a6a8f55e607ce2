After a poor start Pirates finished seventh and SuperSport United eighth.They will meet again in the Nedbank Cup final at Peter Mokaba Stadium next Saturday. If their second-half performance yesterday is anything to go by, the final - the last match of the 2015-2016 season - will be entertaining.Chances were few and far between during the 90 minutes at the Soweto venue despite a promising start.Kingston Nkhatha could have given the visitors the lead inside the first minute, but shot straight at Brighton Mhlongo. The new Bafana Bafana boy blocked Nkhatha's attempt and the ball fell into Dove Wome's path, but his shot went over the bar. At the other end Tendai Ndoro responded for Pirates when he broke free from the defenders in the eighth minute but his shot was diverted for a corner by Mario Booysen.A minute later it was Thabo Rakhale's turn, but the midfielder's shot after a pass from Sifiso Myeni was wide.Pirates dominated but battled to break SuperSport's defence so Thabo Matlaba tried from distance in the 20th minute. SuperSport goalkeeper Ronwen Williams dived for a good save.Ndoro tried again on the stroke of half time, but his attempt was off target.Immediately after the restart, Nkhatha had another opportunity but fluffed it, his shot nowhere near the target after a cross by Thuso Phala.Six minutes into the second half, Mpho Makola attacked from the right and laid on a pass for Ndoro, but the Zimbabwean's tame effort went into the stands.SuperSport had a penalty appeal turned down in the 56th minute after Phala went down from a challenge by Edwin Gyimah. Referee Phelelani Ndaba waved play on.Williams then produced a superb save to deny Thabo Rakhale's curling effort in the 67th minute. But he could do nothing to stop Sifiso Myeni's stunning left-footed strike a minute later to give Bucs a 1-0 lead.The Tshwane side fought back and equalised in the 78th minute through Bradley Grobler, who benefited from a pass by Jeremy Brockie.Pirates got a penalty when Phala brought down Matlaba in the box. Makola converted to restore the lead with four minutes remaining.SuperSport's Denwin Farmer had the last say as he scored the equaliser right at the death.Scores
