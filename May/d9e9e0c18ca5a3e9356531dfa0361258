The 2015-16 English Premier League season has been one marked by the unpredictable, below-par performances of clubs expected to be fighting for the title. Put simply, they've been disgraceful.Chelsea woke up from its slumber in round 17 when Dutchman Guus Hiddink, 69, took over.At that exact stage, Manchester City gave up the league lead and never got it back.Sitting just behind them waiting to pounce were Arsenal, but their response was typically lousy. By this point of the season, Manchester United had slid out of the top four.And Liverpool - they never seriously entered calculations.ARSENALTransfer spend: 15-millionPre-season expectation: Title contenders. This looked the Gunners' best chance in almost a decade, with experienced goalkeeper Petr Cech joining a stable lineup headlined by the likes of Alexis S nchez, Mesut zil and Aaron Ramsey.Catalyst for disaster: A horrific spate of injuries in October and November stretched Arsene Wenger's squad. The likes of Santi Cazorla, Francis Coquelin, S nchez and Ramsey joined long-term absentees Tomas Rosicky and Jack Wilshere on the sidelines.As many predicted, Wenger lacked depth in key areas.Biggest flop: Frenchman Olivier Giroud (37 appearances, 13 goals).Honourable mention must go to Theo Walcott (28 appearances, five goals). The 27-year-old needed goals on the big stage and didn't get them.Season synopsis: Despite their at times threadbare squad, Arsenal sat on top of the league heading into the New Year as Giroud and zil formed a prolific goalscoring combination.But fatigue set in, Giroud's goals dried up and with trademark deficiencies re-emerging, they lost top spot after a 1-0 defeat to Chelsea in late January.The Gunners never recovered the lead, but despite persistent protests about Wenger's management, they could finish the year as high as second. They play Aston Villa today.MANCHESTER CITYTransfer spend: 152-millionPre-season expectation: Title contenders. The addition of Kevin de Bruyne to play alongside Sergio Aguero, supported by fellow big-money buy Raheem Sterling, was supposed to propel the Citizens back to the top of the tree.Catalyst for disaster: The 4-1 loss to Liverpool in late November broke a five-match unbeaten run for City and also saw them surrender the top spot in the league.They never fully recovered.Biggest flop: Yaya Tour (31 appearances, seven goals). His output, in terms of goals scored and chances created, has waned drastically.Season synopsis: City flew out of the blocks, winning its first five and occupying top spot in the league 13 times during the opening 16 rounds.But a dip in form, accompanied by mid-season injuries to captain Vincent Kompany, Aguero and De Bruyne, saw them slip to fourth.It was no coincidence that after Manuel Pellegrini's impending replacement by Pep Guardiola was announced in February, they lost their next three matches against Leicester, Tottenham and Liverpool.Heading into the final day, their Champions League place remains insecure - and it could have been worse had Manchester United beaten West Ham United in the thrilling encounter on Wednesday.MANCHESTER UNITEDTransfer spend: 104-millionPre-season expectation: Champions League qualification.Louis van Gaal splashed the cash and a new-look United, with the likes of Anthony Martial, Memphis Depay, Morgan Schneiderlin and Bastian Schweinsteiger, was supposed to have no trouble competing on three fronts.Catalyst for disaster: A disastrous December saw the Red Devils drop out of the top four thanks to three straight losses to Bournemouth, Norwich and Stoke City and their style of play often bored Old Trafford to tears. Despite all Van Gaal's protestations, the style of play laboured and it appeared United were not progressing under his leadership.Biggest flop: Schweinsteiger (18 appearances, one goal) just shades fellow summer arrivals Depay (27 appearances, two goals) and Schneiderlin (27 appearances, one goal) for the gong.Season synopsis: United made a great start to the campaign, winning eight of their first 13 matches to sit second in late November. But they consistently dropped points throughout December, January and February, before Martial and youth team player Marcus Rashford stood up in Wayne Rooney's absence to revive their top-four hopes. And where would they be without David de Gea, again?LIVERPOOLTransfer spend: 83-millionPre-season expectation: Champions League fringes.Brendan Rodgers splashed the cash on attacking midfielder Roberto Firmino, striker Christian Benteke and defender Nathaniel Clyne but questions remained over the quality of Liverpool's spine.Catalyst for disaster: Despite losing the final match of the 2014-15 season 6-1 to Stoke City, the Reds allowed Rodgers to continue at Anfield.After giving him a further 83-million in the summer, the Northern Irishman was sacked after round eight with the side languishing in 10th spot.Biggest flop: Benteke (26 appearances, eight goals) signed for 32-million and barely makes J rgen Klopp's first choice match-day squad when all players are fit.Liverpool's biggest mistake was not parting ways with Rodgers earlier.Season synopsis: A position in the Europa League final does little to paper over the crack exposed again in another woeful league campaign for Liverpool.But Klopp's arrival has added an atmosphere of hope ahead of next season.CHELSEATransfer spend: 72-millionPre-season expectation: Title contenders.Defending their crown was always going to be hard but there were few signs of such a catastrophic crumble.Catalyst for disaster: Somewhere in Chelsea's pre-season it all fell apart.Was it the extra holidays granted by Jos Mourinho after winning the Premiership title? Was it a lack of renewal in the transfer market? Or was it simply that an ageing group had enjoyed its "last hurrah" in their dominant 2014-15 title run and were sliding off the cliff?Biggest flop: Eden Hazard (30 appearances, four goals).It took until round 35 for last season's player of the year to score a single goal.Season synopsis: What started as a minor slump ended in catastrophe for Chelsea as title-winning manager Mourinho was sacked after 16 rounds following a loss to eventual champions Leicester City, which left them languishing in 16th place.The 69-year-old Dutchman Guus Hiddink arrived and the Blues went unbeaten in 15 league matches, before falling to Swansea City, Manchester City and Sunderland in recent weeks, while also falling out of Europe.Just 12 wins in a Premier League title defence season is appalling in anyone's language. - foxsports.com/au
