There is an explosion of life, of joy, in the city that no Leicestershire natives ever expected to be part of. We know where the players, the 5000-1 outsiders to win the English Premier League (EPL), were on Monday night. They broadcast their own celebration from the home of Jamie Vardy, their rags-to-riches goal scorer, as the EPL title was handed to them by an implosion of Tottenham Hotspur at Chelsea 2-2 in a draw.

It was Arsenal manager Ars ne Wenger who said last week that Leicester City is a compelling psychological study because not one of its players was born on a red carpet to play in the Champions League.No, sir. Leicester's players had to toil, fight, to make themselves believe that together they could earn the right to win the English league, and next season to enter the realm of Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Barcelona - clubs that put together teams costing six times the knockdown prices at which the Leicester City players were valued as a whole.</img>Andy King celebrates after scoring the second goal for Leicester.

Who, other than Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, the billionaire from Bangkok who saved Leicester City from insolvency six years ago, foresaw the club taking on the world in this fashion?A Thai benefactor, players from non-league competitions and from nine different lands, and this mentor from Rome who, in his 30 years as a coach (and before that 12 years as a player) had never previously won a top title.There are people who believe that it was karma, the blessing of Leicester's King Power Stadium by monks from the Buddhist temple where Vichai worships, that has made this happen.There is the other story, linked to the bones of a former king of England, Richard III, being buried in Leicester, where he fell in battle.There is the way that all the big clubs - Chelsea, Manchester United, Manchester City, Arsenal and Liverpool - fell beneath their very expensive parts to lay the trophy open to a team like Leicester.It would be demeaning if it were not so wondrous.This is the triumph of the improbable, the example to children everywhere that in sports, achievement starts with believing and can become reality through the process of hard work and of collective spirit.</img>Leicester City fans Image: REUTERS Andrew Boyers Leicester City fans Image: REUTERS Andrew Boyers When people ask where will this end, they should go back one year to when Leicester was the last-placed team in the EPL. It was then, fighting against relegation and fighting together for survival as a team, that Leicester turned fear into something peerless.Ranieri arrived in the summer, a coach fired by Greece, his then 27th job as a manager, because the Greeks had lost to another fairy story - the Faroe Islands.When the Srivaddhanaprabha family interviewed candidates to take over their modest little team, they asked Ranieri whether he would be prepared to stay should Leicester be relegated. He said he would. But, the wily fox of a nomadic manager that he is, Ranieri apparently also negotiated a 5-million bonus for himself in the event that he helped Leicester to be EPL champions.More than likely, the owner considered that to be an easy clause to sign. But he liked the manager who could even contemplate the unthinkable.Those of us who have been around Ranieri, and have seen how at his training sessions he can appear the most childlike enthusiast on the playing fields, appreciate that there is a humility about him that is contagious. He loves the ball almost the way an infant learns to.Leicester is his 28th team on a managerial road that has encompassed Italy, Spain, Monaco, Greece and England.Italy's Gazzetta dello Sport newspaper cast him this week as Emperor Claudius Britannicus. This is one Roman conqueror that Leicester folk will follow wherever he takes them, onward and upward into Europe.- The New York Times News Service
