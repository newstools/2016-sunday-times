Bidvest Wits draw earlier in the day left them capable of only amassing a maximum of 65 points, which is only three more than Sundowns now have after a satisfying victory. It was a game that had it all a red card, an own goal, a penalty, a handball goal and some horrible refereeing calls, although in the end the errant refereeing did not impact heavily on the outcome.Defender Lorenzo Gordinho will now forever be known as the Hand of Gord after punching the ball into the net to give Chiefs the lead, but his luck ran out in the second half as he was sent off, handling the ball again.Leonardo Castro equalised just before the break and Sundowns took charge in the second half to secure the points with defender Thabo Nthethe converting a penalty and then midfielder Willard Katsande turning the ball into his own net. Chilli Boys make Wits sweat for one pointAfter all the concern that Sundowns might be tiring under the weight of a taxing programme of fixtures coming thick and fast, the performance produced a strong physical showing, muscling their rival out of the game. They had the hallmark of champions.It was always going to be a night of high drama from as early as 40 seconds when Castro was cautioned for an elbow into the face of Katsande. By the 20-minute mark there were two more yellows, but referee Robert Smith lost his pedantic enthusiasm when Hlompho Kekana s goal-bound shot struck Keegan Ritchie on the hand and might also have been touched by Mulomowandau Mathoho in the same movement. But no spot-kick was awarded despite the furious protests of the home team.Sundowns slightly shaded the early initiative, particularly with their pressing game as they locked Chiefs up and it was only after the half-hour mark that Reneilwe Letsholonyane got a first effort towards goal for the visitors but volleyed over the top.But in the 35th minute, Chiefs went ahead when a corner was played short and George Maluleka whipped in a cross that Gordinho attacked with a diving header at the back post, but steered the ball home with his fist rather than head. Again Sundowns protested the injustice, but again the match officials missed an important moment. PSL teams fighting to avoid relegation On the stroke of half time, Sundowns were awarded a soft free kick near the corner flag after Kgotso Moleko s challenge on Keegan Dolly, and Khama Billiat lofted a ball in towards the near post, where Castro expertly glanced home to take his tally of league goals into double figures.Chiefs had a penalty appeal when George Maluleka went down in the 49th minute but when Mathoho got his hand in the way of Mzikayise Mashaba s cross, Smith had no option but to finally award a penalty. Itumeleng Khune went the right way but Nthethe struck it well into the corner to hand his side the lead.Nine minutes later Gordinho, having been booked earlier, foolishly handled the ball and was sent off.In the 70th minute, the folly continued as Katsande gave away a needless free kick for a rough challenge on Colombian international Castro. The kick was whipped in by Billiat, and Katsande stretched to turn the ball into his own net.That ended the contest as the two sides rang the changes and Sundowns closed up shop to emerge now as champions-elect.Ki c ko f f was delayed for 15 minutes because of concern over fan safety as too many spectators were still seeking entry by the scheduled kickoff time an all too frequent problem, but exacerbated by unnecessary road closures by Tshwane Metro.Sundowns 3Chiefs 1
