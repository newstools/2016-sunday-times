1) Exfoliate &amp; moisturiseDark lipsticks and chapped lips don t mix. Use a wet face cloth to gently buff away dry skin. Then apply a moisturising lip balm that s not too waxy otherwise the colour won t stick.Try a simple facial moisturiser or Labello Lip Butter in Vanilla and Macadamia, R30, which includes shea butter (and also has a scent similar to vanilla). Newly launched Optiphi Active Lip Balm, R350, is specially designed to soothe lips with its ingredients of coconut oil, shea butter and ceramides.2) Outline lipsUse a lip liner in a colour closest to your lipstick shade or try a transparent one (Smashbox Always Sharp Lip Liner in Clear, R255) to keep your shade from creeping past your natural lip line. Alternatively, fill in your entire lip with the liner this will make your lipstick shade last longer. Baby, it's cold outside: Winter beauty products to beat the chill3) Apply your shadeWhether you like to apply it straight from the tube or prefer to use a lip brush, it s all a personal preference. Apply from the centre of your lips outward towards the edges of your lips. One of our favourite shades this season is Rouge Dior Lipstick in 813 5th Avenue, R595.4) Blot &amp; dabTo make your lipstick last, try the blot and dab technique. Take a two-ply tissue and pry the layers apart. Apply one layer to your lips and use a big fluffy powder brush doused in transparent powder over the tissue to absorb excess shine. This a clever way to make your favourite hue matte and also to set the colour. Apply another layer of lipstick to increase the colour pay-off.5) Finish it offComplement your boldly berry or cocoa-hued lips with very little else. We re talking just a swipe of mascara, some concealer to hide dark circles or redness, a bit of foundation, powder and that s it! If you want a glossy finish like the girls at Dior, a clear gloss will add shine. Apply it to the back of your hand and use a fingertip to apply.
