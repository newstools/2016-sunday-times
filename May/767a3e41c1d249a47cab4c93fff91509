It was apt that Downs and the PSL's best player of 2015-16, Khama Billiat, scored a fittingly beautiful 24th-minute winner so the champions could crown their season with a victory.Fittingly too, Downs smashed the imposing record set last season of 69 points by Kaizer Chiefs, finishing on 71.In the open stand, Downs' "mellow yellow" basked in the late afternoon winter's sun, and radiance produced by their team on the field. This has been among the prettiest, though also brutally effective, of PSL title winners of the past 15 years.Past seasons have been notable for some epic clashes and nail-biting finishes. Sundowns and Kaizer Chiefs have been alternating for the title in the past two seasons. This season did not have the dramatic finale. It was enjoyable because of this Sundowns team.The "CBD" attacking trio of Leonardo Castro, Billiat and Keagan Dolly and their mesmeric understanding.Behind them Hlompo Kekana, Mzikayise Mashaba, Thabo Nthethe and Wayne Arendse provided the foundation.It has been a Sundowns lineup that has harkened back to the classic lineups of the 1990s.Perhaps it was a blessing in disguise Downs were knocked out of the Caf Confederation Cup on away goals with their 2-0 second-leg defeat to Medeama in Ghana midweek.Now coach Pitso Mosimane and his technical staff can regroup and launch themselves into an attack on the Champions League.Stars hung onto an impressive third place despite the defeat.Downs scored with a goal of as much balance and balletic beauty.Dolly's chip through from left midfield was with the nonchalance and accuracy of an Ernie Els approach shot to set Billiat free .It might have been hard for Downs to keep their foot on the gas after the break.But this was Downs' afternoon.Ndumiso Mabena stepped up and hit a spot-kick inside the right upright, only for diving keeper Kennedy Mweene to snatch it out of the air. There is no denying that Pitso Mosimane's men were the best of the lot this season.Scores
