With Bafana's stalwart right-back Anele Ngcongca ruled out through injury, the still relatively unknown Thopola seems to have at least a 50/50 chance of playing in the now effectively dead rubber at Independence Stadium in Bakau. He will compete for the position with Mamelodi Sundowns' also uncapped Ramahlwe Mphahlele.Bafana have not won once in the four games they have played in the group, and are left playing for pride in their final two games.Thopola has been rewarded for showing promise in the Chippa side that has caught attention playing attractive football under former Orlando Pirates captain Dan "Dance" Malesela and has achieved a best-ever sixth position in the PSL.Mpumalanga Black Aces coach laments poor firepower among PSL strikers"Thopola gave Chippa a lot of balance," Malesela said. "When I arrived he was playing at centre back. Once he switched to right back we hardly ever had a problem defending from that side. He also gave us options because he's very good going forward, and useful in terms of what he delivers in the final third. And he can use both feet."Thopola, 26, made a late start to his PSL career when he was brought to Chippa by their coach at the start of the past season, Roger Sikhakhane, who had worked with the defender at First Division Thanda Royal Zulu.Having concentrated on school work until matric, the defender had only played amateur and schools football until he joined former Ajax Cape Town coach Steve Haupt's Pretoria-based Vodacom League academy team Berea Albion.Thopola was introduced to Thanda coach Neil Tovey by Haupt at a Safa coaching course at Tuks Stadium in 2013."In the NFD that year they were introducing the Under-23 rule, which I qualified for. Coach Neil called me for a try-out," the right back said.Thopola has thrived under Malesela's attacking football."Coach Dan likes playing beautiful football," the defender said. "But it took time for the players to get it. From the sidelines it might look easy, but playing carpet football never is."
