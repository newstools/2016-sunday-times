 We boarded an 11-hour flight from Johannesburg International to Z rich Airport. A short flight later, we finally arrived in Nice. Stylish Stars who ruled the red carpet at the 69th Cannes Film FestivalAfter a 30-minute drive from the airport, we arrived at the luxurious Hotel Martinez. Frequented by celebrities during the festival, the hotel is a beautiful blend of modern and classic. The hotel also played host to Elie Saab's showroom, where we got an exclusive look at the label's haute couture designs. On the second night of the festival we made our way to the Palais des Festivals, where we watched Jodie Foster's new film 'Money Monster'. On the red carpet, we loved Freida Pinto, Kendall Jenner and Vanessa Paradis in Elie Saab.A bumpy 15-minute ride took us to the small island of Saint Honorat. This perfect lunch-time retreat is home to about 20 Cistercian monks, who tend to the island's renowned wine-producing vineyards. Cannes: It's more than just that film festivalOur Cannes experience would not be complete without a spritz of Elie Saab's Le Parfum Rose Couture, R1,110 for 50ml EDP. With notes of rose, jasmine and orange blossom, the fragrance is all romantic elegance. A specially curated Rose Couture playlist by Elie Saab added some sweet jams to our Cannes party.
