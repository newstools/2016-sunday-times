Like the final three years ago, when striker Bernard Parker's extra-time goal sealed a 1-0 victory for Stuart Baxter's Kaizer Chiefs over United, this was another tight affair for the former Bafana Bafana head coach as Matsatsantsa overcame Orlando Pirates to clinch the Nedbank Cup and end a disappointing Premier Soccer League season with something to display in the cabinet.United's management must be giving themselves a huge pat on the back for bringing in Baxter halfway through the season rather than waiting for the new season to bring in the experienced man.The Englishman has hit the ground running and they are probably just itching for the 2016-17 season to start so that they can challenge for the league title.If yesterday's performance is anything to go by, then United may just be contenders for the title. They came from behind and it looked far too easy for them at times, more so in the first half thanks to some horrendous defending from their opponents. United didn't play fancy football. But they took their chances. They went a goal down on 13 minutes when Luvuyo Memela scored from close range after goalkeeper Ronwen Williams' save from a Tendai Ndoro shot fell to the winger to open the scoring.It was a lead that lasted only two minutes for the Buccaneers. The man who levelled matters - Jeremy Brockie - is a man who scored a stunning volley at this venue in the last 16 of the competition last season.The New Zealand-born Brockie was poorly marked when he headed home from close range, following a cross from his compatriot Michael Boxall on the right flank.United took the lead when striker Bradley Grobler volleyed home after Brighton Mhlongo's save from a Brockie shot fell kindly to the former Platinum Stars striker.Pirates supporters could not believe what they were seeing when United scored a third before half time, from the boot of Boxall. The right back was rewarded for not giving up in his run into the opposition half, as he headed home a loose ball in the box to give United a great lead going into the break.At half time, it looked as though United would cruise to victory, but the introduction of defender Happy Jele for midfielder Thabo Rakhale brought stability to the Pirates defence and an own goal by Clayton Daniels nine minutes on ensured that the match would not end as a one-sided affair.Also, an injury to Williams, which meant that second-choice goalie Boalefa Pule had to come on, made things a lot interesting.Pirates pushed forward in an attempt to get an equaliser, but they just could not find an opening and Pule also played a role when he made a good save to stop Thabo Matlaba's powerful shot in the 84th-minute.For Pirates coach Eric Tinkler, this defeat is harder to take after they lost out in the Caf Confederation Cup final in November.</img>Sibusiso Khumalo of Supersport and Thabo Rakhale of Pirates during the Nedbank Cup Final between SuperSport United and Orlando Pirates at the Peter Mokaba Stadium in Polokwane.

Dancing circles around Pirates The action for yesterday's Nedbank Cup final started before the final ... on the freeway.Traffic was stopped for several minutes on the N1 from Johannesburg to Polokwane as Orlando Pirates supporters protested two of their number's cars being impounded for some unfathomable reason.Eventually, the dispute was resolved and the Bucs fans' impromptu roadblock was lifted.Once they got to Peter Mokaba Stadium, these same supporters would have hoped their team's defence could have been anywhere near as effective stopping the "white boy" onslaught spearheaded by Jeremy Brockie and Bradley Grobler.Mpumalanga Black Aces coach laments poor firepower among PSL strikersWhen last did any PSL side field as many footballers of the pale skin variety as SuperSport United can? Dean Furman, Michael Morton and Michael Boxall added to the complement."'Where do they all come from? How do they run so fast?'," must have been the thoughts going through the Bucs player's minds as they allowed Matsatsantsa to line-dance circles around them.A moment's silence was held for the legend, Ted Dumitru, who had once coached Pirates.El Professore would have been displeased at the frenetic pace of this game. Until the end a purist of possession football, he would have clucked his tongue and scowled at the scene before him through those telescopic lens-thick glasses. We'll all miss him nonetheless, or the more for it.SuperSport coach Stuart Baxter had to go into hospital on Thursday with an allergic reaction. The cortisone injection the Englishman/Scot had, though, did its trick as Baxter bounced across the touchline showing no signs of sluggishness.Unlike the defence of Orlando "roadblock" Pirates, who parked a Vespa.sports@timesmedia.co.za
