Take SuperSport United midfielder Michael Morton for instance. This is a man who was overlooked by Gordon Igesund in the first half of this season, but he did not twiddle his thumbs on the sidelines."I kept myself busy, studying just to keep the mind occupied, otherwise you spend every day thinking about the situation and then you get into a bad space. So I am doing a personal training course. Every year I try to add something on my CV, so that I do not retire as an unemployed footballer," said Morton, whose career has been revived since coach Stuart Baxter replaced Igesund. "I also completed my BCom in management two years ago."Six months ago, Morton was not completely sure about his future, but a lot has changed under Baxter. He is a regular player and has won himself a new two-year contract."It's a massive weight off my shoulders. If you asked me six months ago if I would get a new deal, then I would not have had an answer," said Morton."The coach [Baxter] has changed my fortunes and I'm playing regularly. My wife and I are happy because we were not keen on moving."The first major silverware Morton won was in 2010 when Bidvest Wits lifted the Nedbank Cup at FNB Stadium."We organised something like 250 tickets and we gave them to all my high school and primary school friends and my family. I have the jersey and the medal framed. My dad passed away after the final. It's the last game he watched."The 27-year-old Johannesburg-born star player will get another chance to lift the same trophy when United take on his former club Orlando Pirates in the final at Peter Mokaba Stadium in Limpopo on Saturday.
