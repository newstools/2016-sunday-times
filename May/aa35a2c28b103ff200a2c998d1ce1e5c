Defeat left Norwich second-bottom in the table, with only already-relegated Aston Villa below them and two points shy of safety with two league games left this season.Mata struck in the 72nd minute after a missed header by Norwich defender Sebastien Bassong cleared the way for a run into the box by United's Wayne Rooney.United's victory saw Louis van Gaal's fifth-placed side close to within a point of local rivals Manchester City, who currently occupy fourth place, and the last qualifying position on offer to English clubs for next season's Champions League.City play third-placed Arsenal at Eastlands today. After that match, United will have a game in hand on City.Leicester - the 8th wonder of the worldMeanwhile, United manager Louis van Gaal has admitted that his midfielder Marouane Fellaini must show more restraint following his three-game ban for elbowing Leicester defender Robert Huth.But Van Gaal insists he has sympathy for the Belgian international because of the provocation from Huth, who was also given a three-match suspension for pulling Fellaini's hair in the incident that sparked the altercation in last Sunday's 1-1 draw at Old Trafford."We don't have an appeal because I said already that the reaction of Fellaini is like a human being," said Van Gaal, who will lose Fellaini for three Premier League games but have him available for the FA Cup Final against Crystal Palace later this month."When the FA gives Huth a suspension of three matches, then they admit that it was a penalty and I said that also after the match. So for us it's very disappointing but the referee was not seeing the fact, and I still believe Fellaini makes a reaction like a human being but he has to control himself better, that is true."But when you grab somebody by the hair, always this situation shall exist." Fellaini will end the season as he started it - serving a suspension - after he was punished for stamping on Hull's Paul McShane in the final game of the last campaign. His absence won't help United's bid to qualify for the Champions League via a top-four finish.Despite a solid recent run, the often-criticised Van Gaal has been left to count the cost of a mid-season slump and some indifferent results against lower opponents.In midweek, at United's player of the year awards event, Van Gaal claimed expectations at Old Trafford are too high and that a debilitating pre-Christmas injury list scuppered his team's season.
