The following are the unsung heroes in Pitso Mosimane's side.Wayne Arendse: The 31-year-old has been a colossal figure in defence, making up for the two or so years he spent on the bench. With 25 appearances in the league and two goals this season, the Capetonian has helped Sundowns to 14 clean sheets.Thabo Nthethe: The 31-year-old does a lot of the talking, guiding his teammates to make sure the defence is always organised. It's no surprise the club have the best defence in the league (20 goals conceded).On seventh heaven: Pitso's smooth operationThe Bloemfontein-born defender rarely panics. With 27 league appearances and a goal, Nthethe performed well as captain when Ramahlwe Mphahlele was injured.Tebogo Langerman: The 30-year-old defender has kept right wingers quiet this season and still manages to get forward and deliver great crosses.The Johannesburg-born left back has made 22 appearances thus far, with a goal and three assists. He is definitely one of the most consistent players in the team.Mzikayise Mashaba: Need a left back? Call Mashaba. Need a left winger? Call Mashaba. Need a central midfielder? Call Mashaba.The versatile Mashaba, 27, played in all these positions and delivered when the club needed him. He managed 18 appearances and a goal.Asavela Mbekile: Like Mashaba, the 29-year-old Mbekile has been called on to play in different positions.When Mphahlele was injured, Mbekile slotted in at right back. He's also played in central midfield. His performances earned him a call-up to the Bafana Bafana squad for the Afcons qualifiers against Cameroon.
