Exactly five years to the day that Baroka were beaten on penalties by Black Leopards in the semifinals in this competition, they again failed to live up to the promise they showed in previous rounds as Matsatsantsa a Pitori made the most of the chances they created in the second half after a poor display in the first 45 minutes by the hosts.Just a few hours before kickoff, the Premier Soccer League announced that the cup final would be played at the Peter Mokaba Stadium, just a walk from the Old Peter Mokaba Stadium, where Baroka play their league matches. The giant-killers from Limpopo must have been excited to hear the news, but when it was time to deliver they froze and let an averageUnited team knock them out of the competition that has not had a second-tier club in the final since 2009. Baroka s dream of winning both automatic promotion to the PSL and the Nedbank Cup is now over. Come May 28, they will be watching the final from their TV sets.The score, however, wasn t a true reflection of the game. Baroka dominated the first half, passing the ball around with Ayanda Jwara and Caswell Chauke in central midfield.On the wings, Donald Mokondelela and Nkosinathi Ndlovu were causing problems for the United fullbacks with their pace and skill.What they needed was a finisher upfront and a man who has been scoring the goals for them this season, Thabiso Kutumela, was on the bench waiting for his chance.Coach Kgoloko Thobejane decided to go with Lucky Mothwa as a lone striker, but he was unable to make an impact until he was replaced early in the second period by Sphamandla Sangweni.Baroka, who had a goal disallowed for offside, went into the break the better team, but without goals they were always in danger of losing the game. And that s exactly what happened.Matsatsants a broke the deadlock just two minutes into the second half through striker Bradley Grobler, a man who seems to be enjoying football again under the guidance of coach Stuart Baxter.Bad defending by right-back Lala Ntsoane allowed Grobler to get into the box and beat Baroka goalkeeper Oscarine Masuluke at the near post.Once in the hunt for glory, Gavin Hunt's now a shadow of himselfMasuluke never really looked confident in goal and it was no surprise when he was beaten by Grobler s left-footed shot.United sealed their place in the final against Orlando Pirates when Thuso Phala scored the second six minutes later following a pass from Jeremy Brockie. The Bafana Bafana winger made a run from deep, controlling the ball before toepokingit into the top corner.The visitors we r e not the same after conceding the two goals, but they will now need to put the disappointment of missing out on the cup final behind them and focus on winning automatic promotion.They play their final game of the season in seven days against Milano United in Polokwane.United, meanwhile, can look forward to challenging for silverware after a season of poor results in the league.Coach Baxter will be hoping he can win this competition at the first time of asking with United, just as he did at Kaizer Chiefs.
