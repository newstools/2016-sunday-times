Downs now take a healthy lead to the second leg of this Caf Confederation Cup play-off round in Tarkwa, Ghana on Wednesday, May 18, the final round before the group stages.Medeama took the lead through Eric Kwakwa's opening stunner from range after 40 seconds. For 79 minutes a sluggish Sundowns could not fight their way back into the game.Then goals from Leonardo Castro (80th minute), a gem by Khama Billiat (84th) and substitute Cuthbert Malajila (87th) saw the Brazilians come right back into the tie.On seventh heaven: Pitso's smooth operationDowns have reached the play-off round as Champions League second-round losers.Perhaps, with a tough act next season of a league and cup double to follow, and the Champions League that Downs covet so much to play for from January, motivation for this game was not as high as it could have been.Downs coach Pitso Mosimane certainly never skimped on the stars who wrapped up a superb league and cup double with a 3-0 Absa Premiership win against University of Pretoria at Tuks Stadium on Wednesday night.Mosimane had all his first team performers in their places, apart from goalkeeper Denis Onyango with an injured hand, who was replaced by Wayne Sandilands.Medeama, founded in 2002, are not among Ghana's elite football clubs.The ambitious side, owned by steel magnate Moses Armah, have won three cups, though. They qualified for this competition by winning their second FA Cup last year.There was little the initially flat Downs could have done about Medeama's opener inside the first minute.Perhaps the PSL's defending champions could have been more alert from the kickoff in trying to prevent the Ghanaians moving the ball down the left, then feeding Eric Kwakwa on the inside. But goalkeeper Sandilands and his defence could not have stopped the winger's straight rocket through the chilly Atteridgeville air that left all the Brazilians rooted. Medeama had opened the scoring through their own merit. That Downs could not equalise was more down to their own syrupy legs.Khama Billiat had a chance to shoot, bursting down the left, but took a touch too many and was dispossessed. Mzikayise Mashaba was far more alert, picking up the loose ball to strike the left upright.How many times has anyone seen Downs win the ball in defence, as Wayne Arendse did late in the half, then lose it again before leaving their own half?Sundowns picked up their work-rate in the build-up from the change-rooms, but remained woeful in front of goal.Anthony Laffor skied an attempt after a pass behind him and Leonardo Castro was unable to glance a near-post header from Dolly's cross on target.But you can't keep a champion down. Billiat's corner from the right found Castro at the near post again, and this time the striker had his angles perfect to beat goalkeeper Muntari Tagoe.Then Billiat, far to the right of the penalty box, received back a blocked attempt at a cross and hit it first time on the volley.Call it instinct, call it brilliance or call it blind luck, the second attempt floated over Tagoe's head and into the net.Downs perhaps even made the tie safe as Malajila stabbed in a third.
