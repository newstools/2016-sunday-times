The pressure has eased marginally on the Dutchman this week after securing safe progress to the FA Cup quarterfinals and setting up a Europa League last-16 tie with Liverpool.However, Van Gaal remains the bookmakers' favourite to be the next top-flight manager to leave his post and Mourinho is as short as 1/6 to succeed him.The pair worked together when Van Gaal managed Barcelona, but he feels no need to speak to his former assistant about the speculation, which he described as a "scandal". Foxes out to keep nose in front"[Mourinho] has said things a number of times with a lot of words," Van Gaal told TV channel RTL7. "But he does not have to tell me anything. I find the whole thing ridiculous."We, the club and I, are not going to help the media by denying things. I think what is happening is an absolute scandal."Meanwhile, Van Gaal has accused people of misinterpreting his side's form and results as he insisted this season hasn't been as bad as some have argued.United are fifth in the Premier League, six points adrift of a Champions League place.That progress in knockout competitions has lifted Van Gaal's spirits, particularly the 5-1 victory over FC Midtjylland on Thursday night.The Dutchman was particularly keen to point to the number of youngsters he has thrown into the first team, because of a crippling injury list."It is not normal that you have 14 injured players," said Van Gaal, after Anthony Martial became the latest to pick up a problem, a tight hamstring, before the Europa League game."Nevertheless, we are still in three competitions, we have a lot to fight for."Asked why United were so bad against Sunderland and Midtjylland, in the first leg, but so good against Shrewsbury in the FA Cup and against the Danes in the second leg, Van Gaal accused the media of stirring things up."The media makes it bigger than it is."
