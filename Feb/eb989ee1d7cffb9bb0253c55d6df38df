Ranieri is backing his players to recover from their shattering defeat against Arsenal and continue their fairy tale season at the top of the league. Leicester have captured the imagination of the nation after a stunning campaign and are on course for a place in next season's Champions League, an achievement Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane insists would be "special for football".Arsenal's 2-1 win at the Emirates this month was only Leicester's third defeat in the league this season and Ranieri wants his squad to channel the frustration of losing in the last minute into the final run-in.But the 64-year-old is convinced the next five games will prove pivotal, with home matches against struggling Norwich City and West Bromwich Albion up next."The next five matches are the turn - then the run in and the goal is there. I think this is the key moment for us."I'm very focused on these five matches - after we can say where we are: 'We are here, OK, keep going', or 'No, what happened'. Now we have to think about these five matches," he said."I look always forward, to the top, I never see behind. Every time we fight for the maximum, every match three points."The next five are the most important, the key, today until the new break. After March 19 we don't play more, there is another break. For this reason, I said the five matches are a key point." Hammers have worst supporters, says SamLeicester are two points ahead of Tottenham Hotspur and also face Watford, Newcastle and Crystal Palace before the international break.Unlike their rivals Spurs, Arsenal and Manchester City, Leicester's run-in will not be complicated by the demands of other competitions after they were knocked out of the FA Cup last month.Manuel Pellegrini, the City manager, claimed Leicester's hopes of winning the title will be boosted by their lack of fixture congestion and Ranieri said it could be the difference."I don't know if it gives me an advantage - but, believe me, I am their fans when they play in Europe: 'Come on, man!' The more they win, the more they play, it's much better for us," he said."It could be an advantage, at the end we'll see if it was a good opportunity for us or no."But the next two games will be very tough."I believe my players are intelligent and they will start with the same idea as the other matches."
