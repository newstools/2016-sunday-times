There is the chance of redemption at Centurion, the Wanderers and Newlands in the coming days but those odds are as stretched as the days are currently long for the Proteas.Yesterday the Proteas lost by five wickets and though they again showed remarkable resolve to play themselves back into contention England got over the line chests bulging thanks to some surgical back-end hitting from Jos Buttler (48 not out, 28 balls).Proteas captain AB de Villiers admitted Buttler played it tactically spot-on when the game was in the balance. McKenzie joins Proteas as batting coachHis biggest lament, however, was not having 20 more runs to add to the Proteas' 262 for seven on a slow surface."I thought 280 was par," said De Villiers. "We've got the potential in our batting lineup to get 300 but that would have been exceptional. I got out at a bad time. And a few dismissals later we were in trouble and we did well to get to 260 in the end."De Villiers fell to an outstanding catch by Chris Jordan again on this tour, exemplifying England's ability to seize the moment.The Proteas got the short end of the stick in the DRS reviews but their ill- conceived application hardly helped their cause.In a city that by sight and sound would have had a distinctly homely feel for the tourists, Eoin Morgan's team looked comfortable from the start.During the test series we were told that Alex Hales (99, 124 balls) was more of a limited-overs practitioner and he looked the part yesterday.Hales effortlessly drove down the ground and his eyes sparkled just before his bat flashed at anything short.Hales found a more than capable ally in Joe Root, who admittedly like the South Africans earlier in the day, was forced to go about his business as if barefoot at a Greek wedding. The pair shared a stand of 97 before Root's off stump wasn't so much uprooted as mildly disturbed by Kyle Abbott.Morgan in concert with Hales pressed on before Morne Morkel, in an act of near desperation, came back into the attack with England requiring roughly a run a ball with 16 overs to go.Morgan and the redoubtable Ben Stokes lost their wickets as the hosts gained belief before Hales fell tantalisingly short of a ton off Kyle Abbott.Though De Villiers feels his team were a few runs short, the Proteas' attack too requires attention. U-19s failure 'is part of development'Bloemfontein proved brutal on all in the attack but the Proteas' game plan of shared responsibility beyond their four recognised bowlers still doesn't convince. JP Duminy and Farhaan Behardien conceded 93 runs between them in the first ODI and yesterday 62 were knocked off them in 10 overs. The trade off between what they offer with ball and bat needs interrogation.Another miscreant from earlier in the week, Marchant de Lange, was left out here yesterday as was Chris Morris, though in the case of the Titans allrounder he must feel a million bucks. Morris was snapped up for that amount by the Delhi Daredevils in yesterday's Indian Premier League auction.Kagiso Rabada's return to the side was well received but didn't quite carry the sting the Proteas had hoped for.The Proteas struggled at the start of their knock, until Faf du Plessis (47, 48b) proceeded down the wicket to generate energy into his shots, but even then it was with measured aggression.De Villiers' and Duminy's 107-run partnership proved restorative but it was a slow mend.After a string of low scores De Villiers at least was in the runs again and run he did in compiling a sedate 73 (by his whirlwind standards) that contained just four fours and a six.It was a day for the hard yards and England, having put in most, will go to Centurion with a spring in their step.
