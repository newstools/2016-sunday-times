Downs edged an advantage over an excellent Chicken Inn in the first half with Wayne Arendse's 35th-minute headed goal. The hosts went on all-out attack in the second half, but could not bury a string of chances. Then in injury time, Khama Billiat was brought down and Mashego buried the winner from the spot.One group of Sundowns supporters in the main stand held aloft a live chicken, whose beak was set in a grimace of pure displeasure at the indignity of being used as a mascot to an opposition team's supposed inferiority.Chicken Inn, though, are no chickens. Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane's warnings before this competition started that his team had a very tough opening hurdle draw were proved by Inn's 1-0 first leg win in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe.That match wasn't televised in South Africa, but last night Chicken Inn showed all who watched just how right Mosimane's forewarning was.The coach predictably had his big guns on the field, making no changes from a 2-1 midweek win against Mpumalanga Black Aces that went a long way to sealing Downs' claim as Premier Soccer League champions-elect.He again had the muscle of big Ivorian Soumahoro Bangaly in central midfield next to Hlompho Kekana, useful in countering Inn's lightning quick front-runners, who had troubled Downs last week.Chicken coach Joey Antipas had proclaimed he had a plan to bring to Pretoria after his close look at the Brazilians in the first leg. He had his quick front line set up to aggressively push at the offside line against a slow Downs defence.The result was a match played at an at times frightening pace, Sundowns' muscle and sophistication weighing in heavier against the skilful running of the visitors.Early on, Billiat controlled a Keagan Dolly chip on the edge of the area and his skidding shot was pushed around by Inn goalkeeper Elvis Chipezeze.A free kick floated in by Kekana was headed wide at the far post by Arendse. Then the defender finished a similar chance at the right upright from Billiat's free kick.Anthony Laffor replaced limping Downs left-back Tebogo Langerman soon after.Before the break, Inn's left-wing Edmoe Chirambandare's skills had goalkeeper Denis Onyango at full stretch to stop a ball across goal.Mosimane had the confidence to bring on the more attacking Siyanda Zwane for Bangaly at the start of the second half. And Downs did attack like a hyena stalking the chicken pen.Two minutes in, Laffor headed Mzikayise Mashaba's free kick a foot over. Kekana then fed the Liberian on the right to hit the side-netting.Misheck Katswairo - the scorer in Bulawayo - hit wide in a rare chance in the half to the visitors.Arendse had a third close-range header, from Dolly's corner, cleared off the line.Chicken took some wind out of Downs' sails when, after a move of some 10 passes, substitute Clement Matawu forced Onyango to save from two metres.Moments after the announcement on the PA system of three minutes' injury time, Billiat went on one of his beautiful runs into the area, and went down under contact from Bernard Passmore.Mashego, on for Asavela Mbekile in the 89th minute, slotted to the right of Chipezeze.Sundown: 1 2Chicken Inn: 0 0Mamelodi Sundowns win 2-1 on aggregate
