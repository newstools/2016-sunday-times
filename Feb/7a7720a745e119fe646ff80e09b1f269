"It all started as a bit of fun in my kitchen, the idea of sharing simple recipes to help people get lean. All of the meals were ready in 15 minutes and the videos were only 15 seconds long," he said. A video posted by Joe Wicks #Leanin15 (@thebodycoach) on Feb 10, 2016 at 4:57am PST Lean in 15 is his first cookbook - and is the fastest-selling fitness and diet book in the UK. Why? Because it's not just another diet cookbook. Carbs are not taboo. He loves broccoli and calls the florets midget trees; there's lot of sage advice and useful tips on shifting your body fat by eating more and exercising less; and the recipes aren't the usual low-calorie offerings but a selection of 100 yummy ideas that are super easy and can be whipped up in a flash. 'Lean in 15' by Joe Wicks is published by Pan Macmillan and available from leading bookstores at R349. Try some scrumptious recipes from this book.
