At the end of his explosive 145-run innings, the popular New Zealand captain felt a mixture of pride in what he had achieved and embarrassment at breaking a record set by his childhood hero Viv Richards.The Kiwi skipper, at his brutal best, belted the fastest test century as he thrashed the Australian attack on the first day of the second test in Christchurch. T20's big challenge: keeping mojo aliveThe 34-year-old took just 54 balls to reach his hundred in a landmark innings to celebrate his final test before bowing out of international cricket.New Zealand were 32/3 when McCullum went to the middle and by tea they were 273/6 with McCullum out for 145.It was a masterclass of aggression from McCullum after Australia won the toss and made New Zealand bat on a green wicket.Although the call paid dividends for Australia in the early overs, McCullum blasted New Zealand back into the game.He reached his 100 two balls faster than the previous record shared by Viv Richards and Misbah-ul-Haq.With the first of the six sixes he hit he overtook Australian Adam Gilchrist's record for the most test sixes and finished with a new mark of 106. He also hit 21 fours in notching his 12th test century.With New Zealand fighting to save the series after losing the first test, McCullum's aggression had set his side up for a first innings 370 and Australia were 57/1 at the end of the first day.The 34-year-old said that when he went to the middle on a seaming wicket, and with New Zealand in trouble, he felt attack would be the best form of defence. It's time SA began to enjoy the game and heal the hurtWhen he brought up his ton, McCullum had no idea it was a record performance and after he found out he was slightly uncomfortable at removing Richards' name from the record books."He was my idol. I'm almost embarrassed to go past him to be honest, but hopefully he enjoyed a little bit of the stroke making."As McCullum pounded the boundaries, the Australian bowlers could only fire the ball down and hope, but when they finally claimed the wicket there was nothing but praise."It was pretty amazing striking," said spinner Nathan Lyon. "He's been a credit to the game of cricket the way he's conducted himself for New Zealand for a long period of time and to see him come out there and do that was pretty amazing."There was one element of luck in McCullum's audacious display when he was on 39 and Mitchell Marsh pulled off a spectacular catch only for the wicket to be disallowed because the James Pattinson delivery was ruled a no ball.Asked what his approach would be in the second innings, which will be his final appearance after 101 tests, McCullum had a succinct answer: "Swing hard."
