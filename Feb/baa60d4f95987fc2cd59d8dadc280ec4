Allardyce endured a difficult relationship with West Ham fans, many of whom were glad to see the back of him when he left at the end of last season.Having said his new club, Sunderland, are supported by fans who are far more "lenient" when things go badly, Allardyce claimed the biggest challenge at Upton Park was trying to repair the damage done to morale by abuse from the terraces. He spent four seasons at West Ham, guiding the club back into the Premier League in his first season via the Championship play-offs, before stabilising them in the top flight ahead of their move to the Olympic Stadium later this year.But some supporters were openly hostile towards the 61-year-old because of the style of football he played, and although Allardyce claimed they were only a "small minority" there is no doubt things turned sour for him in East London."I think I was appreciated by the majority of fans," he said. "It was a small minority who made themselves very loud and very clear about how they felt about me at the time. That wasn't just me, it was all the managers who have been at West Ham."Appreciation from the fans is always very important. Nobody wants to be booed or be told to get out or get off, but it happened. It happened [to me] at Newcastle [United], too."You want to try and deliver what the fans want. At Sunderland they want to stay in the Premier League and I want to keep them up, too."Allardyce knew what to expect when he took over at West Ham in 2011 and claimed that everyone in football knows their fans are difficult, even if they do not admit it. "You accept that's the way it is at that football club," Allardyce added. "And because it's like that, no matter what you do, at some stage you'll get criticised."I knew that before I went there, because you ring people up who used to manage and that is what they would tell you."
