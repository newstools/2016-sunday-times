The Gunners' 2-0 last-16 first-leg defeat by reigning champions Barcelona at the Emirates Stadium on Tuesday all but ended their dreams of winning a maiden Champions League title for yet another season.But Arsene Wenger's men, currently two points behind shock leaders Leicester City and level with north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur, could yet end the week at the summit of English football if they beat United and other results go their way. And Arsenal captain Per Mertesacker, a World Cup-winner with Germany, said there was no question of heads dropping among his teammates, who are aiming to give the Gunners a first English championship since 2004."We have never done that this season, particularly when we have lost a game we have tried to bounce back quickly," the central defender said."I think we have a great chance to do that again and to show we are still in a strong position and still competing for the title."Arsenal now face a United side looking to win three matches in different competitions in a week after victories over Shrewsbury and FC Midtjylland in the FA Cup and Europa League eased some of the mounting pressure on manager Louis van Gaal.Speculation over the Dutchman's future at Old Trafford is unlikely to end any time soon, but this week's wins do at least mean that United, fifth in the Premier League and 12 points behind Leicester, still have a chance of ending the season with some silverware.What made Thursday's 5-1 defeat of Midtjylland, which secured a 6-3 aggregate last-32 success, all the sweeter for United supporters was that 18-year-old striker Marcus Rashford, who is a product of the club's academy, scored two goals on a senior debut that only came about after Anthony Martial had been injured in the warm-up.Van Gaal has been accused of disrespecting United's traditions in both favouring an overly cautious style of play and also ignoring the players that have been produced by the club's once-famous youth system.But Thursday's match, which former United manager Alex Ferguson witnessed from the stands, would have been more to the liking of the club's supporters. Meanwhile, Tottenham Hotspur, who last won the English title in 1961, face Swansea City at White Hart Lane today.Spurs are currently a hard team to dislike. After their significant 2-1 win at Manchester City, head coach Mauricio Pochettino went about embracing his players, hugging each of them and roaring words of encouragement.The squad responded with open arms, reiterating the unity their Argentine boss has forged.Pochettino has earned the respect of his players, who look prepared to run through walls for him and their teammates.If this mentality can be maintained, then Tottenham can win the title and for once finish above Wenger's Arsenal in the Premier League table.Spurs go in search of a sixth straight top-flight win against The Swans today.
