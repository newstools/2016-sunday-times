Don't fret about SA's Under-19 Cricket World Cup woes in Banladesh, says Cricket SA (CSA) - the ultimate goal is producing future Proteas.Warner, Marsh set up decider against KiwisIn 2014, then head coach Ray Jennings' SA side was the toast of the town after they claimed the nation's first ever International Cricket Council trophy.Things have not been as glowing for the current side coached by Lawrence Mahatlane, which has failed to defend the title of the biennial event.After two defeats in the opening matches, not even the two wins that followed in the remaining pool games were enough to save them from a demoralising elimination.The side will now fight for a place in the ninth/10th place play-off final when they face neighbours Zimbabwe in a Plate semifinal tomorrow.Rewind back 10 years, when Jennings first took the coaching reins of the under-19 side - a star-studded team were beaten by Nepal in a Plate semifinal after having lost to the West Indies and Australia.Despite the failed attempt, captain Dean Elgar, batsman Richard Levi and bowler Wayne Parnell went on to represent the Proteas, while Craig Kieswetter, who was part of that team, later represented England. In South Africa, there is a heavy reliance on the schools system as the breeding ground for upcoming talent "If you remember in 2006 when Ray Jennings first coached the team, they exited early from the World Cup, and we are seeing a repeat of that now," CSA general manager Corrie van Zyl said."It doesn't mean that because the current team had an early exit the players are not good enough."From the 2014 side, it is only Kagiso Rabada who has made it to senior international cricket. The fast bowler became the eighth under-19 player under Jennings' guidance to have graduated to the Proteas. Toyana has stars in his eyesIn South Africa, there is a heavy reliance on the schools system as the breeding ground for upcoming talent, while in other nations, like Australia, academies are the backbone of their development.CSA, under the guidance of Van Zyl, has implemented programmes to help the "strong" schools system in fast-tracking the identification and development of youths.With SA having only won the under-19 World Cup once since its involvement in 1998, is our development route taking cricket forward or is there a need to revisit and reassess how things are done?"Following [the 2006 tournament], CSA established the Talent Acceleration Programme (TAP), with the school structure being the backbone, and that incorporates the national age-group regional and national competitions where teams are selected," said Van Zyl."The TAP was introduced, in addition to these regional and national weeks, in order to identify talent at an earlier age, identifying the next cycle of players to feed into the under-19 side."
