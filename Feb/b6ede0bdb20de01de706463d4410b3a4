1. MulchSpread a 5-10cm layer of organic materials, such as bark chips, dry leaves or nutshells, on your flowerbeds to protect plant roots, discourage the growth of weeds and keep the soil from drying out prematurely in the heat of the summer. This is especially important during the nationwide drought we are currently experiencing.2. Mow regularlyThe secret to a great lawn is regular mowing. Lawns, especially kikuyu, tend to grow rapidly at this time of the year, and if the grass is allowed to grow too long, mowing will result in unsightly dead spots. Encourage a healthy lawn by following the one-third rule. Ensure you don't cut away one-third of the grass blade in a mowing session. You can donate your cut grass to the Hope Grass Project, which collects lawn cuttings from homes and companies around the country, and distributes them to farmers who use them for desperately needed animal feed.

Water regularlyWatering is incredibly important at this time of the year, even in areas that enjoy a decent amount of summer rainfall. In order to make the most of our scarce water resources, it would be wise to use rainwater, zone your garden into high, medium and low water-use areas, replace exotic with indigenous plants and apply a water-wise watering schedule.4. Get plantingNow is the time to sow your first crop of winter vegetables: spinach, cabbage, artichokes, carrots and onions. Plant drought-resistant alyssum, elegant delphinium, fragrant dianthus, ornamental digitalis purpurea, popular petunias and long-lasting verbenas.5. Protect your rosesRose bushes need extra protection before going into autumn. Spray your roses to prevent black spot, rust and mildew. Balanced rose fertiliser at the base of the bush will help the roots to establish themselves in the soil and remain disease-free. It's important to wait until spring to prune, as you don't want to encourage new growth.
