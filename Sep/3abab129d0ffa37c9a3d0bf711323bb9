"I'm really happy that 20 years after my first CD, I'm still working as a performing artist," she told the Sunday Times this week.The 58-year-old singer is a headline act at this year's Standard Bank Joy of Jazz, which starts on Thursday.The 19th edition of the annual music festival will feature Khumalo and a host of internationally acclaimed musicians and singers, including Grammy-winning flautist Wouter Kellerman, four-time Grammy winner Deniece Williams, Sipho "Hotstix" Mabuse and Lira.Earlier this year Khumalo released her sixth album, A Breath of Life, under her label, Magnolia Vision Records. Make the whole world sing"As an independent record label owner it isn't always possible to have the money you need to do what you need to do," she said of the seven-year hiatus since her last CD.Khumalo, who was previously signed to Sony, said she had decided to go independent about 10 years ago."I was turning 50 and I was like really ... let me go independent. I was comfortable in my own skin and I was just feeling things needed to happen in a particular way."Despite an illustrious career, Khumalo said she was still learning the art of jazz."Do you ever get proficient in jazz? I feel like I'm still exploring and discovering things. It's a lifelong journey. You never stop learning. I don't feel that one will ever know jazz."Khumalo said jazz in South Africa was in "a beautiful place", highlighting the growth of young woman musicians."For me that is one of the best things that could happen for an industry."More than that, I sense a groundswell of creativity from young people."Relaxation for the singer, however, means no music."When I listen to music, I am working."South Africa's first lady of song also shops and reads."I might not buy anything, or I might buy something and bring it back the next day," she said with a chuckle.
