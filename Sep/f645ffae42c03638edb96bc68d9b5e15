"Messi is on his own but Kevin is in the next table and he is right up there," said Pep Guardiola of his Manchester City player.De Bruyne was very good last season too, scoring seven and assisting nine in all competitions, but looks to be playing at an even higher level under new management, in a system built specifically to get the most out of his very unique talents.So how has Pep Guardiola done this?Utilised in best positionManuel Pellegrini played a 4-2-3-1 and 4-4-2, often shunting De Bruyne into wide positions to accommodate him in the side. How Zidane turned Real aroundAs injuries had their effect on selection choices, De Bruyne naturally became the central playmaker and was brilliant at it.In his final year in the Bundesliga he recorded a staggering 20 assists and 10 goals, and as a result, Guardiola has seen fit to make sure most of City's attacking play goes through De Bruyne.City's 4-1-4-1 gives room for two advanced playmakers, meaning Guardiola can fit almost all of the attacking talent at his disposal into one balanced starting XI.The idea is that Sterling and Nolito stay as wide as possible to stretch the opposition defence and create space for De Bruyne and Gundogan to run into from deep.Ability to find spaceDe Bruyne's astonishing assist statistics and the number of key passes he makes per game (3.4 per game this season in the Premier League) are a result of his understanding space and how best to use it.No matter who De Bruyne is playing against, he always seems to be unmarked in a massive space. It's the kind of thing Xavi and Andres Iniesta were good at and Guardiola's tactical setup is geared to support this.Incredible on the counterattackMaking use of that space is another thing entirely and De Bruyne's tactical and positional nous is incredible. There are few players more devastating on the counter-attack than the Belgian.Weight of passDe Bruyne not only sees the game about five steps ahead but his ability to play the pass to complete the move is outstanding.By firing passes between players packed tight together, lines of defence are broken and the team can attack more dangerously.Guardiola likes his players to choose and execute these kinds of quick forward passes.Xavi, Lionel Messi, Sergio Busquets and Andres Iniesta all make similar forward passes in and around the box - it's how they often break down a packed defence. Collymore: Young guns are being milkedHe sees things nobody else doesCity's opening goal against Bournemouth was one of those only a forward-thinking maverick might score. De Bruyne comes with a reputation for being able to find the top corner, so naturally the goalkeeper and defenders expect that's where he'll aim.These are just examples from this season, where De Bruyne has played five games, assisted three goals and scored two.When you consider that De Bruyne isn't even credited with assists for three of the goals mentioned above, yet has been the sole influence behind all three, has also hit the woodwork at least twice, it's clear to see that he's an incredibly important player.He might not be able to dribble past an entire team like Messi but De Bruyne sees the game in a similar way - always a few steps ahead, always a little clearer than other top quality forwards.It is this ability to solve a defensive Rubik's cube each week at high speed in intense Premier League games which makes De Bruyne so unique."Kevin is one of the best players I've worked with," said Guardiola. He's managed a few good ones.
