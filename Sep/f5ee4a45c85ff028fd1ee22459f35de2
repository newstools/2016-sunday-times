The 22-year-old is slowly building a following of fans, regardless of their footballing allegiances, and it's all down to his performances online.The Belgian became Antonio Conte's first summer signing when he made a 33-million move from Marseille after Belgium's Euro 2016 exit.With Diego Costa in such fine form for the club, Batshuayi's first-team appearances have been limited. But he is already making quite a name for himself on social media.We are all too used to the banal posts from footballers on Twitter.It's become common for footballers to be mocked on social media with a familiar variety of memes and GIFs, but it's rare for a footballer to reply to the mockery. MAGICAL MAESTROBut Batshuayi is a refreshing break from the norm. He started in Chelsea's 4-2 win over Leicester City in the English Football League Cup on Tuesday night, spurning a number of opportunities to score.When Batshuayi had a close-range shot saved by goalkeeper Ron-Robert Zieler, one internet wag posted, in reference to Batshuayi's "Batsman" nickname, a meme of Batman with his head in his hands along with the caption: "Batshuayi after that miss".Clearly not one to be upstaged by an online troll, Batshuayi responded with this brilliant tweet.Yeah I saw the bat signal but the keeper didn't agree with me obviously? #leftfoot #topcorner.His cheeky retort was shared over 2000 times as fans celebrated his "unreal tweeting".Referring to himself as "Batsman", the former Olympique Marseille striker regularly replies to fans on Twitter - even when the tweets are bizarre and even lewd.Batshuayi has made four appearances for Chelsea since his move in June, all from the substitutes bench.
