Every Ted Baker store has a unique design, and the inspiration for this one comes from Joburg's Shakespeare garden, which is a highlight of the city's Botanical Garden in Emmarentia.Ted Baker, a dab hand in the garden himself, saw it as an apt tie-in to help bring a little Elizabethan grandeur to his SA offering. The space has antique oak floors contrasted with a black and white chequered in-lay, gilded ceilings, conservatory-style panelled walls and, of course, lush plants with plenty of hanging greenery.Adding to the theme are famous Shakespearean symbols and artefacts, such as the skull from 'Hamlet' and the scales from 'The Merchant of Venice', as well as neon quotes on the walls. The sumptuous space serves as the perfect backdrop for Baker's SS16 menswear, womenswear and accessory collections.www.tedbaker.com
