The meal packs provided follow guidelines set by the UN Children's Fund and are nutritionally balanced to provide support to vulnerable children.The CEO of the group, Saira Khan, pictured, took up the challenge of cooking a meal - adding a few extra ingredients - to show just how nutritious and delicious a R2.90 meal can be. One meal pack can feed 6 adults or 10 children. 1) Open 1 packet of the Stop Hunger Now meal and remove sachet of vitamins and minerals and set aside.2) Fry 1 diced onion and 2 cinnamon sticks in 60ml (4 tbsp) oil till the onions are soft.3) Add 1 diced tomato, 15ml (1 tbsp) mixed masala, 5ml (1 tsp) turmeric and 5ml (1 tsp) salt and cook till the tomato softens. Add a little water and reduce the heat.4) Add 250ml (1 cup) frozen vegetables, the contents of the Stop Hunger Now meal packet, and 3 cups of boiled water.5) Bring to a simmer and cook, gradually adding 2 cups of water, until the rice and lentils are cooked.6) Cool slightly then add the contents of vitamin and mineral sachet and mix very well. (The heat would destroy the nutrients if added during cooking.) Garnish with chopped coriander.7) Delicious on its own or serve with atchar, dhal, poppadoms or bread. You can vary the meal to include chicken or beef, cooked, before adding the Stop Hunger Now meal pack.
