In the early '90s, Ab Fab the series lurched onto our screens. There was something irresistible about Edina (Jennifer Saunders) and her sidekick Patsy (Joanna Lumley) as they stumbled drunkenly from one mishap to another, swigging from a bottle of Bollinger.The world's love affair with Eddy and Patsy has continued for over 20 years, but it stands to reason that each new outing of the characters might be the one where the concept "jumps the shark", and we end up wishing they just ... hadn't. So is this the case with the Ab Fab movie?Emphatically not. Yes, it's silly. Yes, it's so crammed with celebrity cameos you'll miss 10 A-listers if you glance down at your popcorn, and yes, it follows the timeworn tradition of TV-to-film adaptations and sends the characters off to an exotic location. But the Ab Fab movie succeeds through its sheer good-naturedness.Edina's PR business is teetering. She's in desperate need of a top client, and has her eye on Kate Moss (playing herself). In a desperate attempt to attract La Moss's attention, Edina accidentally pushes her off a roof, and she falls into the Thames and disappears.In disgrace for allegedly killing the world's most famous model, Eddy and Patsy are forced to go on the run (conveniently to the South of France).If you're looking for depth, a message or a convoluted plot, this is not the film for you. But if you're after froth, sunshine and a harmless 90 minutes with characters you know and love, squeeze into your Louboutins and go, sweetie darling, go.
