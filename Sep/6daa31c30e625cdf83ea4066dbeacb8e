Q: I heard a rumour that smoking affects a man's performance, is it true?A: Smoking is one of the most common causes of impotence and possibly erection size. In one study, researchers found that smokers' penises are significantly smaller than those of nonsmokers.In addition to damaging blood vessels, smoking may cause damage to penile tissue itself, making it less elastic and preventing it from stretching.A man who smokes has twice the risk of erectile dysfunction than one who does not smoke. Men who smoke also have low sperm counts. So, yes, smoking does affect sex!Q: We have three kids and two were not planned. The stress makes me not want to have sex with my wife.A: The risk of a contraceptive failure can be a big source of anxiety for some couples, especially those who've had an unplanned pregnancy or a scare in the past. That anxiety can, in turn, lead to erection problems - and cause the same vicious circle that makes performance anxiety such a mood killer.I am firmly of the view that more men should have vasectomies, as they have an effectiveness rate of 99.9%.Dr Tlaleng Mofokeng (MBChB), sexual and reproductive health practice, DISA Clinic, 011-886-2286, www.safersex.co.za
