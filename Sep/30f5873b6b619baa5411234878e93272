Nike showed off the sneakers, called HyperAdapt, for the first time in March, but this week it revealed more about how they will work, CNN reported.The shoes will be rechargeable and lightweight, Nike's public relations director, Heidi Burgett, tweeted last week.Specifics about how to make an appointment "to experience and purchase will be announced in the coming weeks", she added.The laces don't exactly "tie" on their own. The concept is more like automatic buckling or snow boot tightening.Sensors in the shoe detect when it is being worn. A "lace engine" in the base of the sneaker then controls a system of nylon bands that tighten around the foot based on algorithmic calculations, according to a Wired video.The sneaker features two buttons that let wearers tighten or loosen the laces.
