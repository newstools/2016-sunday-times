Oscar winners Michael Fassbender and Alicia Vikander might have made just as convincing a screen couple if they were not intimately involved off-screen, but those who succumb to celebrity gossip pages cannot watch them in The Light Between Oceans without thinking A-ha, this is real! during their love scenes.This does not in any way ruin the film, which is a romantic epic of old-fashioned proportions and timeless preoccupations. Fassbender plays Tom Sherborne, a World War 1 veteran looking for peace and solitude, which he finds by the bundle as a solitary lighthouse keeper on Janus Island off the bleak edge of Western Australia. After a swift courtship he marries Isabel Graysmark (Vikander), the spirited daughter of a mainland inhabitant, and the two embark on a charmed idyll as the only inhabitants on Janus. But Janus has two faces and, as Sherborne was warned at the start of the film, islands can be bad for one s sanity. Add to that a couple of miscarriages and it is impossible not to sympathise when Tom and Isabel decide to keep a live infant washed up with a dead man in a boat. Everything might have been fine, but this is a very small community, so of course it is not fine.Written and directed by Derek Cianfrance (Blue Valentine; The Place Beyond the Pines), The Light Between Oceans is a faithful adaptation of ML Stedman s bestselling novel. If a bit slow at times, it is visually spectacular (do see it on the big screen) and emotionally stirring no one who was moved by the tragic true story of Zephany Nurse will remain dry-eyed as two mothers engage in a tug-of-war over the child they both call their own. Rating: 4/5
