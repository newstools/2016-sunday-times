The former Vodacom executive is one of five moguls who will be bankrolling budding entrepreneurs in M-Net's new reality TV series Shark Tank South Africa.Kumalo, 44, who is married to Basetsana Kumalo, a businesswoman in her own right and a former Miss South Africa, will make his debut next Sunday.He said this week that he was "nervous as to what people are going to say, like I look old and ugly".Kumalo became a household name in 1992 when he co-presented music variety TV show Ezimtoti alongside Caroline Fassie. He also had a radio slot on MetroFM, but left the entertainment industry in 2000 to focus fully on business."People think I started on TV, but I actually had a Saturday and Sunday radio show, and then I was doing television at night and had a full-time job Mondays to Fridays in marketing," Kumalo said this week. "So I had three jobs at 20-something."He said he didn't like TV."When I was asked to do this show, I went to my wife and said: 'Do I really want to do this?'"I've never wanted to be back in show business, but there is a compelling story around the show itself of entrepreneurship, ideas, investing in businesses. I am involved in venture capital now and looking for ideas."Kumalo, who co-owns Washirika - a private equity company with investments in the communication, construction, clean energy and ICT sectors - headed Vodacom's international operations until last year."I had a very successful career in corporate, over 20 years. At some stage I decided I wanted to create my own history and to make a difference."Steve Jobs talks about making a dent in the universe, Steve Biko says everybody is a history maker and I just figured that if I stay in corporate my tombstone would read 'Romeo worked at Vodacom until he died', and that scared the hell out of me."Next Sunday, Kumalo and four other millionaire business owners - Vinny Lingham, Dawn Nathan-Jones, Marnus Broodryk and Gil Oved - will debut as "Sharks" on the 12-episode show. They will be spending their companies' wealth on budding entrepreneurs.Sixty made the cut for the show.
