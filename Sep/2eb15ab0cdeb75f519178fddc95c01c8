Having rotating art and a fun work space is vital to all of us. Even during trying times, we aim not to take ourselves too seriously. Here I am sitting at the "hotdesk" with Studio 19's first and favourite lamp, the Butler, clamped onto the edge of the table with the Archer lamp hanging overhead. In studio with fine potter, Eric LandonA recent addition to the Studio 19 offering is this brass wall lamp, aptly named the Firefly, and our bestselling three-drawer bedside unit. The Legs 11 Ottoman and crazy copper foil cushions stands in front of our life-saving storage cupboards which hide all the samples, swatches and lamp and furniture parts that find their way into our studio. The cupboards even hide our little kitchenette and store of packaging supplies. The sun floods our office every day, making it the warmest place to be. We keep it lush with plants and greenery.
