Liverpool are intense, relentless and look incredibly threatening this season. With only a few smart summer signings, Klopp has created a fast-paced attacking machine, crammed with creative goalscorers and devastating on the counter.They might actually be the most fun team to watch in the Premier League. So how has he done it?Intensity and the gegenpressWe were told Klopp would bring the gegenpress (the counter-counter attack) and doubts were cast over whether the method would actually make a difference in a league where every single player is a finely tuned, super athlete and expected to perform at 100% intensity in every minute of every day. Pep Guardiola is in a class of his ownWhen Liverpool go forward, they do so in numbers. And when they lose the ball, they win it back immediately in numbers.Admittedly, Burnley were somehow able to pull off a 2-0 win, setting a Premier League record for winning a match with the least possession ever (just over 20%), but everybody else has been blown away by the intensity with which Liverpool attack and defend.Retaining possessionLiverpool aren't a one-trick pony though and although this style is similar to how Leicester City played all of last season, Klopp likes his players to keep the ball. Some of the passing moves they make are lovely to watch.Adam Lallana's goal just after half time in the 4-3 win over Arsenal finished off a superb passing move.But for every move - and goal - they put together like this, Klopp's Liverpool are always waiting to take the quick route to goal, as they did in the fourth against Leicester.Running from deepNathaniel Clyne is a busy boy in this Liverpool team, having to provide the width when Sadio Mane cuts inside and to also look after his defensive duties.By providing the width during attacks, Clyne or the leftback frees up Liverpool's central midfielders to make use of the area in and around the box that they're all very good at scoring from. The unpredictable nature of the league adds to the excitement though and Chelsea became the latest casualty of gegenpress on Friday night When they attack down the right, the leftback tucks in and vice versa. When Alberto Moreno played against Arsenal, Liverpool had an attack made up of seven players.Plan BIf Liverpool's short passing to keep possession doesn't create chances and their direct play is blocked out and the fullbacks are prevented from getting down the wings, Klopp's team also has players capable of conjuring magic.Attacking midfielder Philippe Coutinho's freekick against Arsenal was absolutely magnificent.There is much to admire about this Liverpool side and they are entertaining - if Klopp can keep this momentum up, his side should push for a Champions League spot.The unpredictable nature of the league adds to the excitement though and Chelsea became the latest casualty of gegenpress on Friday night.
