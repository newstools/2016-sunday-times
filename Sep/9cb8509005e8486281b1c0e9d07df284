It throws fair play out of the window and the PSL is guilty as charged.It changes the PSL acronym to stand for Preference Soccer League.Those who swear by the mellow yellow colours of Chloorkop will prefer PSL to stand for Precedence Soccer League.Precedence Soccer League because there was a precedenceThere is no putting a veneer on this dubious decision.Sundowns have domestic league fixtures ahead of their Champions League home and away legs.They have to face Maritzburg United on Wednesday night before their away trip to Ndola, in Zambia, to face Zesco United on Saturday.The South African champions have to shuffle back into the country to take on Platinum Stars on September 21 and host Zesco on September 24.When Orlando Pirates were confronted by a similar fixture congestion ahead of their continental commitment - Champions League in 2013 and Confederation Cup in 2015 - concessions were made to give the Sea Robbers space to prepare properly for their African adventures.It was a sensible move, given the distances involved in travelling around the continent.It was also more important, because playing on the continent carries more prestige, as the team has the responsibility of flying the flag of the country.The co-operation afforded to Pirates by the PSL played a huge part in paving their path to the finals of both competitions.As a result of their gallant run, Bucs had a huge backlog of fixtures.They had to play catch up in the PSL programme.If there was allowance for Pirates, why is the same not being accorded to Sundowns?This decision has only served to caricature the PSL in the image of Animal Farm where all animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.It makes supporters wonder why it is that what was good for the goose (read Pirates) is not good for the gander (Sundowns).This opens the door for casting of aspersions and only serves to strengthen the suspicion that Pirates benefited from PSL benevolence because Bucs' big daddy also happens to be the PSL big boss.Perhaps the moment is opportune for a rule to be made official that in the event of a South African team progressing in both Caf club tournaments, the matches of the team(s) concerned shall be postponed.Because they understand the importance of competing and supporting their team, the Zambian league have accorded Zesco postponements in their journey to bring glory to the country's shores.Sundowns have taken it in their stride. These testing situations should make them stronger and strengthen their resolve to even do better in this competition.It is a moment for coach Pitso Mosimane to show what he is made off in terms of juggling his squad around.They made a request to the PSL. It was declined. Tigers don't cry.They just have to roll up their sleeves and get on with it.It would be wonderful if they were not only to go past the semifinal passage. It would be glorious if they went on to win the darn thing, in spite of this rotten foul play. Sies.Twitter: @bbkunplugged99
