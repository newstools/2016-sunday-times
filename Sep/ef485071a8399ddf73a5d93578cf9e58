The aptly dubbed "Sexy Potter" was named 2015 Craftsman of the Year in Denmark, and has become an Instagram sensation thanks to mesmerising videos and shots of his spectacular handmade ceramics. We have a Tortus boutique located in the same location as the studio, which is in a protected building that dates back to 1734. This is a selection of vases on display in the Tortus Boutique. Our production is based on a seamless dialogue between design and handwork. This drives an ever-evolving production of ceramics rich in form, colour and texture, making each encounter with our objects something unique. 5 local ceramicists to keep an eye onThe Tortus Studio is where all our vases are hand made on the wheel by Eric Landon. He also gives week-long workshops in throwing, once or twice a month. This is a shot of our studio entrance from the courtyard. We have a lovely green oasis of a courtyard that gives us tranquility and calmness while working.
