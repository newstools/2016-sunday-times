This season's Champions League is still in its infancy, but Real Madrid's draw with Villarreal on Wednesday means that only two of the 32 Champions League sides still have a 100% record this term: Manchester City and Bayern Munich.City have made a dream start to life under Pep Guardiola and, ominously , the Spaniard reckons there is plenty of room for improvement.The English Premier League leaders have managed nine wins in as many outings in all competitions, scoring 27 and conceding five.The German team Guardiola led until June, Bayern, have themselves begun the new campaign with seven victories and a goal difference of +25 - their defence having been breached just once. We created a fairytale. I think it's not finished yetCarlo Ancelotti also has something that Guardiola does not yet have at City as Bayern lifted the German Super Cup in August.Only three Champions League sides have maximum points, with City (15 from five) and Bayern (12 from four) eclipsed by Basel. The Swiss club have won eight out of eight in their Super League, exactly as they did 12 months ago en route to their seventh successive title.Basel started with 13 in a row in 2003/04.Bayern mustered 10 on the bounce under Guardiola last term, a Bundesliga record, while the distant target for City is the English top-flight record of 11 set by Tottenham Hotspur in 1960 (that run ended with a draw against City, by coincidence).This week's fixturesTUESDAYDinamo Zagreb v Juventus (Maksimir)Leicester City v FC Porto (King Power Stadium)Borussia Dortmund v Real Madrid (Signal Iduna Park)FC K benhavn v Club Brugge (Parken Stadion)AS Monaco v Bayer 04 Leverkusen (Stade Louis II)CSKA Moscow v Tottenham Hotspur (Arena CSKA)Sevilla v Lyon (Ramon-Sanchez Pizjuan)Sporting Lisbon v Legia Warsaw (Estadio Jose Alvalade)WEDNESDAYLudogorets Razgrad v Paris Saint-Germain (Vasil Levski National Stadium)Arsenal v Basel (Emirates Stadium)Borussia M nchengladbach v Barcelona (Borussia-Park)Besiktas v Dynamo Kyiv (Vodafone Arena)Atl tico Madrid v Bayern Munich (Vicente Calderon)Napoli v Benfica (San Paolo)FC Rostov v PSV Eindhoven (Olimp-2 Stadium)Celtic v Manchester City (Celtic Park)
