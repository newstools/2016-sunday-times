Aguero marked his return to action after serving a three-game ban for throwing an elbow in last month's victory over West Ham.The Argentinian striker opened the scoring in the ninth minute and he made it 2-0 25 minutes from time before Raheem Sterling beat Lukasz Fabianski in the 77th minute at the Liberty Stadium.A swift move on the right, a clever turn from Aguero and the visitors were a goal to the good. However, a minute later and the Swans were level. Gylfi Sigurdsson poked a ball through to Fernando Llorente, who beat Claudio Bravo with a stunning volley from 16 yards.The breakthrough came in the 64th minute when Van der Hoorn was penalised for putting his elbow into the face of De Bruyne inside the Swansea penalty area. Aguero scored from the spot with a cheeky chip. Gunners bombard woeful BluesJurgen Klopp disproved his own words of warning as Liverpool crushed Hull City 5-1 at Anfield to climb into the top four of the Premier League.Klopp had written in his programme notes of the uniquely competitive nature of the Premier League, pointing out that there are no easy games in England's top flight.Liverpool's manager also claimed that describing Hull as "just hard to beat" was doing them a disservice.But both those theories were swiftly shot to pieces by a rampant Liverpool side, who scored three goals before half time and could easily have doubled that tally.Hull's cause was not helped by the dismissal of Ahmed Elmohamady after half an hour as the defender blocked a shot from Philippe Coutinho on the line with his arm.James Milner slotted home the resulting penalty to make it 2-0, but even before then Hull had never looked likely to end a record of never having won at Anfield.Liverpool are still to keep a clean sheet this season after Hull substitute David Meyler drove the ball home following a second-half corner.If that was careless from Liverpool, the response was impressive as just 60 seconds later Coutinho strode forward to curl a trademark 25m shot into the top corner for his third goal of the season.Andrew Robertson then tripped substitute Daniel Sturridge to allow Milner to score his second penalty of a one-sided afternoon.
